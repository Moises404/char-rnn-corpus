The Carter IV

Tha Carter IV Intro

[Produced by Willy Will]

[Verse]
Man, fuck them bitches and them hoes
And them niggas pussies, camel toes
I got some money on me, and the weed nice
My shit won’t ever stop, suck my green light
Bitch it’s Carter 4, murder's all she wrote
Now it’s fuck everybody, like a Scorpio
Still running shit, I’m on my cardio
Boy I’m going in, like my water broke
Suicide note, suicide doors
I put in overtime, like a tied score
Tinted windows bitch, that mean mind yours
And the weed loud, like a lion's roar
Stare into the eyes, the eyes of forever
Hear no evil see no evil, Helen Keller
No music on, rock it acapella
And I don’t need a watch, the time is now or never
Tell my niggas love, I die behind this shit
A nigga counting money, you niggas counterfeit
Real nigga nigga, proud of what I am
Young Money is an army, bitch I’m Uncle Sam
Them hoes call me Tunechi, mama call me Tune
I left the bullshit in the waiting room
Straight to the money, no short cuts
Now watch me go retarded, yellow short bus
We do drive-bys, we do walk-ups
And bitch I be so high, I get starstruck
Millz in this bitch, he said fuck them hoes
And the jewelry bright, like summer clothes
And I keep some bud, like Rudy Huxtable
I’m bout to slam the beat, nigga Dusty Rhodes
I’m from eagle street, I go Hercules
I get on the beat, murder 1st degree
YMCMB, we don’t give a fuck
You faker than some titties, you get tittie fucked
This the best worst feeling
And nigga if I die I die a death worth living
This that text book G shit
I’ve been in that water but I’ve never been sea sick
Yeah, knock me I knock ya face off
Life’s a crazy bitch, Grace Jones
Mind of a genius, with a heart of stone
C4, Mr. Carter’s home!

Blunt Blowin'

[Intro]
Yeah, I put my shades on

[Verse 1]
I live it up like these are my last days
If time is money, I'm an hour past paid
Ugh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes; why, that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines
Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times
You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds
And they say never say never, but fuck it, nevermind
I've been gone too long, true or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home, yeah

[Chorus]
And I'm a blunt-blowin', Polo-drawers-showin'
I-don't-give-a-lovely-motherfuck-ass-nigga
With my money growing, no matter where you going
You don't need a bus pass for me to bust yo ass, nigga
I'm a blunt-blowin', Polo-drawers-showin'
I-don't-give-a-lovely-motherfuck-ass-nigga
With my money growing, no matter where you going
You don't need a bus pass for me to bust yo ass, nigga

[Verse 2]
Stunna, I got 'em, I'm back on them bitches
All about my riches, my name should be Richard
Cut the bullshit out, I'm Edward with the scissors
Life is a choice, and death is a decision
Times have changed, but fuck it get a new watch
I still got the vision like a line between two dots
Young Money's eating, the label getting fatter
And yea, the tables turned, but I'm still sitting at 'em
I'm a bad motherfucker cause the good die young
Everybody selling dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one
Man, when that cookie crumble, everybody want a crumb
Shoot that hummingbird down, hummingbird don't hum
Yea, big money, big money, deep pockets
Money talks, and motherfuckers eavesdropping
Bunch of bloods, you could call it blood clotting
Eastside, MOB Piru Damu

[Hook]
I'm a blunt-blowin', Polo-drawers-showin'
I-don't-give-a-lovely-motherfuck-ass-nigga
With my teeth glowing, I'm on my Deebowin'
You don't need a bus pass for me to bust yo ass, nigga

[Verse 3]
Light that Ashton Kutcher, I'm a limit pusher
See y'all dead meat, and me I'm just a butcher
I do it for the money, man I am such a hooker
And freedom was my girl, until they fucking took her
You can look into the future, it's right behind your eyelids
But I don't wanna know, cause shit I like surprises
Why that, why this, why you on that why shit?
Motherfucker ask me why, I say YM
Beach bum, call me Ocean Drive Slim
Drop the top, look up and make the sky grin
Young Mula, skinnies and some Supras
Belly of the beast 'til it puke us, motherfucker

[Hook]
I'm a blunt-blowin', Polo-drawers-showin'
I-don't-give-a-lovely-motherfuck-ass-nigga
With my money growing, no matter where you going
You don't need a bus pass for me to bust yo ass, nigga

[Outro]
I've been gone too long
True or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home
It's Young Mula, baby

Megaman

[Verse 1]
Faded off the Kush, I'm gone
Only 2 years old when daddy used to bring them hookers home
Looking like my Grandma
My niggas got that ammo
We jack-son and then light up the L
Samuel
Tunechi in this bitch, nigga
Y'all niggas bitch niggas
Rats gon' rat
And snakes gon' hiss nigga
Baseball rich nigga, do this shit for all my homies
Where them bad bitches at? Come and put that pussy on me
Tunechi you a murderer, boy you just be killing shit
Yeah you know that money talk, I am the ventriloquist
Tranquilizer in the trunk, put your ass to sleep man
Birdman Junior, got the world in my wingspan
How you niggas want it? Have it your way, Burger King
I get deep in that pussy, dig her out, surgery
Fucking with a real nigga, fucking right, certainly
Break in your fucking home, take your life, burglary
Whoa nigga
Die slow nigga
For dear life you're holding on
En Vogue, nigga
Unload nigga
Reload nigga
Tools on deck, Home Depot, nigga
Well if life is a bitch, then mine a gold digger
Yeah and all my bitches nasty like a cold dinner
Everyday I go so hard and work my ass off
I'm good, I'm 100 like a fastball
It's Carter IV

[Interlude]
Yeah!
I'm going back in man

[Verse 2]
Yeah, we get fuck y'all money
How you wanna play it?
That AK sleep on the side of my bed
That's one eye closed, one eye open
Your cap get peeled like ibuprofen
I'm sick, I'm ill, I ain't the nigga to fuck with
It's a crazy world, and life is shorter than Bushwick
Young Money, man, we got this shit by a land slide
Boy I send them Bloods at your ass like a tampon
Uptown shit, wet the whole party
Weezy gon' ball, bal' like Steve Harvey
The heater I'mma tuck her
Tuck-er like De-lores
That's my word, word like the-saurus
I don't see no future in your fronting, I be stunting hard
Rap game dependent on me like a bungee cord
Fear nobody, but God almighty
Shoot that motherfucker 'til I get arthritis
I'm a beast, I'm a ass, I'm ahead of my class
I'm a diamond in the rough like a baby in the trash
I don't talk it, I live it
I paint a picture vivid
And them pistols popping like they sitting in a skillet
I go so hard, go so mean
I'm so New Orleans
Told the judge I couldn't budge
It was him or me
Forget the bullshit and remember me

6 Foot 7 Foot (Ft. Cory Gunz)

[Hook]
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat; call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy ‘cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted ‘cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture!
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation!
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doin' this shit
Lil Tunechi or Young Tuna Fish

[Hook]
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

I'm goin' back in…

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Okay, I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequence
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these motherfuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasin', tell that paper, "Look, I'm right behind ya"
Bitch, real Gs move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

[Verse 3: Cory Gunz]
Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean
Get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you nigga's the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love
Keep throwin' my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side
‘Cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch
I'm a man, I visit urinals with pride
Tune told me to, I'm shootin' when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a BX nigga, ya heard? Gunna

Nightmares of the Bottom

[Verse 1]
Sleeping at the top, nightmares of the bottom
Everybody wanna be fly until you swat ‘em
But who am I to talk? I ain’t shittin' roses
We in the same picture but we all got different poses
Now I’m looking in my rear view, I see the world in it
I try to slow down, and I get rear-ended
Pause, like a red light, I’m dead right
Highway to Heaven, God, do you see my headlights?
They say you don’t know what you’re doing 'til you stop doing it
Well, call me clueless 'cause I do this
Attention all shooters: I’m a shooting star
Life is a course, and I'ma shoot for par
Searching for today, instead I found tomorrow
And I put that shit right back, man, I’ll see what I find tomorrow
Young Money, CMR, Blood like a scar
Weezy F. Baby and the "F" ain't for "Flaw"

[Interlude]
Uh, uh
Yep, yep
Yep, yep

[Verse 2]
It's like I have it all, but I don't have to worry
Married to the money, a true love story
Only God can judge me, I don't need a jury
Nothing standing in my way like nothing's my security
Back to my journey, that bullshit don't concern me
If I knew I was going to jail, I would have fucked my attorney
If you sleeping on me, nigga, then I hope you toss and turnin'
I'm so cold I'm hypothermic, ask your bitch, she will confirm it, yeah
Now what we doin' with it?
Keep opening your grill, I'm barbecuin' with it
I know my shit already tight so I ain't screwin' with it
Some say this game is a joke, well I hope they get it
Okay, I'm walking on needles, sticking to the point
Yeah, the streets is talking, I'm familiar with the voice
I'm a gangsta by choice, I hope my sons choose wiser
And don't call me "Sir," call me "Survivor"

[Interlude]
Uh, yeah
Uh, haha
And they go "yep, yep"
Yep, yep

[Verse 3]
Uh, call me "Killer" 'cause I make a killin'
I got this shit wrapped up, bow and a ribbon
That's them twin Glocks, you can call them siblings
And them bullets travel, better hope I keep dribblin'
I touch the sky, get the clouds out my fingernails
These bitches think they fly like Tinkerbell
But they all on my wire like Stringer Bell
I let them be, 'cause you know how the sting’ll feel
Know how to whip that white girl, I can spank her tail
And I fuck up any track: train derail
Know how to roll, never need training wheels
And when the truth hurts, I pop pain pills
Uh, all or nothing or nothing else
I bleed reality, I should cut myself
Just had a bowl of riches, and a cup of wealth
And the "F" is for "Fuck yourself"

[Outro]
Uhh, yeah
And I ain’t doing nothing but getting my share, breathin' this air
And Mack moms told me she gon' keep me in her prayers
So I’m feeling alright, I’m tryna stay aware
And if you wanna trip, then I'ma meet you there
To my niggas in the game, keep the game fair
Players play, coaches coach, and cheerleaders cheer
I’m trying to keep spirit when the ghost disappear
Weezy F. Baby and the "F" ain’t for "Fear," uh

She Will (Ft. Drake)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I tell her, "Now go and pop that pussy for a real nigga!"
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well, just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm danglin' my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shoppin' and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real."
And I say, "I ain't doubt you for a second."
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off
And go anywhere but here, baby, you know the deal
‘Cause she bad so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power
And the fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I tell her, "Now go and pop that pussy for me!"
Haters can't see me, but them bitches still lookin' for me
And you could take it to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about I, give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry, call that "wine and dine"
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say "choose wisely," that's why I was chosen
Rockin' like the asphalt, it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of Death and took its mask off
Now I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl's face south and her ass north
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real."
And I say, "I ain't doubt you for a second."
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off
And go anywhere but here, baby, you know the deal
‘Cause she bad so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power
And the fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will

How to Hate (Ft. T-Pain & Young Fyre)

[Produced by Andrew Lloyd and Young Fyre]

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
She owes me everything and she knows it
I've seen all the scenes in this movie, and she blows it at the end
She keeps talking to me, cause she knows that I'm a friend
But I can't keep hearing it over and over again
I was the one that you came to
When you broke up with your boyfriend, man, fuck him
Girl I was the one, that told you fuck them other niggas
And you still went and fucked them other niggas
Most people learn from the bad things
I hope that you learn and don't crash and burn in the fast lane
But if you read this letter then you caught me
This should explain all the ways that you taught me

[Hook: T-Pain]
How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you, I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
And I don't love them hoes
But don't fuck up with Wayne cause when it "Waynes" it pours
No really, I'm on my "fuck that bitch" shit
You used to be the shit, but now you ain't shit, bitch
I had a red bone, but she be tripping though
All that bullshit is for the birds, she was pigeon toed
She used to always say, fuck my niggas
And when I went to jail, she fucked my niggas
Well, I guess I'm single for the night
And you can sit right on my middle finger for the night
And if I sound mad, then you caught me
But this shit explains that you're the one that taught me

[Hook: T-Pain]
How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you, I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Coconut Ciroc
Forgive and forget, bitch I already forgot
I'm over the bitch, and she over the top
They say love is the key, somebody changed the lock
Well, and I wish I never met ya
And I heard you're doing you, and you heard I'm doing better
And all I had to do was put two and two together
But that just makes four, but not four-ever, damn
So much for being the perfect couple
I put in overtime, I was working doubles
I wish you the best, good luck boo
Weezy F, for "fuck you"

[Bridge: T-Pain]
No ain't nothing going on
Girl I'm moving on, just take your ass home
Get away from here girl, I'm so glad you're gone
This is the last song I'm writing for you
Now I see how you can be
I don't want you 'round you me all you do is down me girl
How many years I tried to get ya
Don't even text my phone when it hit ya, cause girl done taught me

[Hook: T-Pain]
How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you, I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches

Interlude (Ft. André 3000 & Tech N9ne)

[Produced by Willy Will]

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Carter IV, it's on
Yeah, it sound like that Lil', man, they be like "Wayne
That nigga right over there, that nigga's from another planet"
Cut the weed, pop-pop
Insanity shit, niggas from this planet can't see
U-u-u-u-uhh

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Hot's what it is, watch what the kid drops
I'ma get the prop if you're not with the biz
Not only other regions, I really popped at the crib
So hatin' motherfuckers, you better stop with the jibs
Off of the thizz, but I'm boss
It don't matter what the cost
When I live right across from the Wiz
Killa City will have a nigga lost in the Mid
Doing nothing but mothers stacking pussy coffin again
What is happening is a merger, different levels of murder
Lil Weezy cook it and I'mma serve her
Further, that's what I'ma get doing this
Rremember when eating Gerber
Mama said to kill 'em all and I heard her
Thank you Baby for what became Lil Wayne
It's gettin' all the people knowin' that Strange in the game
I been really able to hang in the fame
But when he shouted my name, it's been a change in my lane
I'm a Klusterfuk and lovin' nothin' but to get your brain
And I be stuck in lust and quick to a bust a nut
And take a nigga's dame with no shame
When they be bussing 'nough, they thinkin' they thuggin' tough
But never do knuckle up, you in the gang, you bang
You drunk and touching every thang, you lame
Sucka, you cannot sustain the reign
Tech N9ne is such a cuckoo in this
Baller nigga, Strange Music, crew threw swishes
I know a lot of you prolly never knew who this is
Well, you listenin' to Tecca Nina, Soo Woo business

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Today, I feel electric gray, I hope tomorrow neon black
I tell a nigga, "All those flows are borrowed"
It’s the pharaoh, Three Stacks
I woke up in Cairo, lookin’ at stars
So bright in the sky, I thought they were marbles
No car doors, whatcha call those?
AA whole carload, of raw hoes
In a Jeep Defender
Please remember, don’t feed the Simba
Three’s assembled like nobody
He's a symbol of what's safari
Pulled her ponytail to my body
She’s the only girl that was smart e-nough
To call me 'Mr. Benjamin' in the middle of a wild party
Skin was cinnamon; I pound it harder
How come the only girls that are thought of
Are the light ones? Well tonight then
We gon’ do it, do it, do it for the dark ones
It’s important that you are more than
Welcome to Tha Carter IV and
Y’all enjoy it, I will go ‘head
And I’ll kiss y’all on y’all forehead, out

John (Ft. Rick Ross)

[Intro]
Just saw an alien saucer approaching from the sky
Radio contact has been attempted but cannot be established Instructions are to prepare for an attack by an unknown enemy

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Fo’ fo’ bulldog: my motherfucking pet
I point it at you and tell that motherfucker "fetch"
I’m fucking her good, she got her legs on my neck
I get pussy, mouth and ass, call that bitch triple threat
When I was in jail she let me call her collect
But if she get greedy, I’ma starve her to death
Top down, it’s upset
Been fucking the world and nigga I ain't cum yet
You fuck with me wrong, I knock your head off your neck
The flight too long, I got a bed on the jet
The guns are drawn and I ain't talking 'bout a sketch
I pay these niggas with a reality check
Prepared for the worst but still praying for the best
This game is a bitch I got my hand up her dress
The money don’t sleep, so Weezy can’t rest
And AK-47 is my fucking address, huh

[Hook: Rick Ross & Lil Wayne]
I’m not a star, somebody lied, I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car, I got a chopper in the car
Load up the choppers like it’s December 31st
Roll up and cock it and hit them niggas where it hurts
If I die today, remember me like John Lennon
Buried in Louis, I’m talking all brown linen, huh

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Big black nigga in a icey watch
Shoes on the coupe, bitch I got a Nike shop
Count the profits you could bring 'em in a Nike box
Grinding in my Jordans kick 'em off they might be hot, swish!
I’m swimming in a yellow bitch in the red 911 looking devilish
Red beam make a bitch nigga sit down
Thought it were bullet proof till he got hit the fifth time
Drop palmolive in a nigga dope
Make it come back even harder than before
Baby I’m the only one that paid your car notes
Well connected got killers off in Chicago

[Hook]
I’m not a star, somebody lied, I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car, I got a chopper in the car
Load up the choppers like it’s December 31st
Roll up and cock it and hit them niggas where it hurts
If I die today, remember me like John Lennon
Buried in Louis, I’m talking all brown linen, huh

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Talk stupid, get ya head popped
I got that Esther, bitch I’m Redd Foxx
Big B’s, Red Sox, I get money to kill time, dead clocks
You fucking with a nigga who won’t give a fuck
Empty the clip then roll the window up
Pussy nigga sweet, them niggas Cinnabon
I’m in a red bitch, she said she finna cum
200 thou' on a chain, I don’t need a piece
That banana clip, let Chiquita speak
Dark shades, Eazy E, five letters, YMCMB
Bitch ass nigga, pussy ass nigga
I see ya looking, with ya looking ass nigga
You know the rules, kill them all and keep moving
If I died today it’d be a holiday

[Verse 4: Rick Ross]
I’m not a star, somebody lied
I got a chopper in the car, so don’t make it come alive
Rip yo ass apart then I pull myself together
YMCMB, double M, we rich forever
The bigger the bullet the more that bitch gon' bang
Red on the wall, Basquiat when I paint
Red Lamborghini till I gave it to my bitch
My first home invasion, papi gave me 40 bricks
Son of a bitch, then I made a great escape
Ain't it funny mom her only son be baking cakes
Pull up in the sleigh, hop out like I’m Santa Claus
Niggas gather round, got gifts for each and all of y’all
Take it home and let it bubble that's the double up
If you get in trouble that just mean you fucking up
It’s a cold World I need a bird to cuddle up
I call the plays, motherfucker huddle up

[Hook]
I’m not a star, somebody lied, I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car, I got a chopper in the car

I, I see you with your palms in your pants
But me, me, oh me, I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger, I'm a critical thinker
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker, yeah!

[Hook]
I, I see you with your palms in your pants
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger (yeah) I'm a critical thinker (yeah)
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker

[Post-Hook]
I know your name, yeah
Your name is unimportant, yeah (haha!)
We in the belly of the beast, yeah
And she thinking 'bout abortion, damn

[Verse 1]
Uhh, I woke up this morning, dick rock hard
Ashed my blunt in my Grammy Award
You can save your bullshit on your memory card
If this real nigga business, then you niggas unemployed
Jumped on the celly, called Makaveli
He say he was gravy, I say I was jelly
Looked in the mirror, said "You's an ill nigga"
Then I ran to the money like track and field nigga
Now I think I'll have me a coffee with six sugars
In a world full of ass-kissers and dick pullers
I'm tryna walk a straight line but the line crooked
I'm shooting for the stars, astronauts dodge bullets
Yeah, I bought a brand new attitude
The hate is music to my ears, I got my dancin' shoes
Sometimes we question shit that there is no answer to
But I just built a house on I Don't Give a Fuck Avenue

[Hook]
I, I see you with your palms in your pants (haha!)
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger (yeah) I'm a critical thinker (yeah)
I'm a hell of a smoker (yeah) and a bit of a drinker (hey!)

[Post-Hook]
I know your name, yeah
Your name is unimportant, yeah
We in the belly of the beast, yeah
And she thinking 'bout abortion, damn

[Verse 2]
Uhh, down on the ceiling, looking up at the bed
Life is a gamble, better check the point spread
And when life sucks, I just enjoy the head
I'm so sick of these niggas, I need meds
Uh, smoking on that hallelujah, thank you Jesus
Help me focus on the future and not the previous
Double R, I'm a rebel with a reason
Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees
Underground shit, I see myself as a seed
Living in the glass, and everybody's looking
But how can you get the picture if you don't know who took it?
This current affairs, but who the hell cares?
Everybody's fighting over positions, musical chairs
On the road to redemption, you gonna use a few spares
I'm just fucking ready so I come prepared

[Post-Hook]
Yeah I know your name (hey!) yeah
Your name is unimportant, yeah (listen mayne)
We in the belly of the beast, yeah
And she thinking 'bout abortion, damn

[Bridge]
And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Life is a rollercoaster, but still unfair
A blessing in disguise is right before our eyes
But since it is in disguise, we don't know that it's there

[Hook]
And I, see you with your palms in your pants
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger, I'm a critical thinker
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker
I know your name...
As it is, shawty

I make her cum first, then I follow the leader
I talk shit, I hope it matters
We climax, without the ladder
Can't desert the future, no Nevada
Her body is a weapon, ratatat her
I spent the night in heaven, I slept with an angel
And when we finish, I swear that pussy said thank you
I said, "You're Very Welcome" I'm so well mannered
And I go down south, Louisiana

[Hook: John Legend]
Baby won't you spend the night
Darling I don't want to wake up, and you are not by my side

And if you promise me tonight, Yeah
Baby that you'll let me in, then I'mma make you feel so special girl
(So special, so special,so special, so special)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Then we take a shower together, and wash each others back
And if she kick it off, I'ma run it back
And then she say my name, like I forgot it
She crazy about that dick, Lorena Bobbitt
Love be the pilot, but it's kamikaze
Yeah, body language, girl let's talk about it
Freedom of speech, Weezy a beast
Open her up like a book, read it and weep

[Hook]
Baby won't you spend the night
Darling I don't want to wake up, and you are not by my side
(So special, so special,so special, so special)
And if you promise me tonight, Yeah

(So special, so special,so special, so special)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, thinking bout you girl got my mind on E
You know them other niggas ain't me
Girl I got that 12 play for ya, that 12 play for ya
Just sit on my grill, that's that tailgate for ya

I tear it up like loose leaf paper
I got drinks on chill, my bedroom huge
I knock her lights out, I blow her fuse
See we don't even fuck no more, we make love
And now shes on the tip of my tongue, my taste buds
Cause she my honey bee, yeah, buzz buzz
And now I'm itching and scratching, that's that love bug

[Hook]
Baby won't you spend the night
Darling I don't want to wake up, and you are not by my side
(So special, so special,so special, so special)
And if you promise me tonight, Yeah
Baby that you'll let me in, then I'mma make you feel so special girl
(So special, so special,so special, so special)

(Girl I got that 12 play for ya)
(So special girl, so special to me)

How to Love

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Cut the music up
A little louder

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
When you was just a young’un, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryning put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and crooks still crook

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
See I just want you to know that you deserve the best
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful
Yeah, and I want you to know
You’re far from the usual, far from the usual

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
You see you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love

President Carter

[Produced by Angel "Onhel" Aponte and Infamous]

[Intro]
God bless america...
- Carter, are you prepared to take the constitutional oath?
- I am...
- Will you place your left hand on the Bible and raise your right hand and repeat after me, I...

[Hook]
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter

[Verse 1]
Sitting on the world, I got life in my hand
So these days I try to think twice when I can
Money on my mind as God as my witness
Love don't live here and it don't even visit
I do this for my Uptown politicians
Walked in the kitchen and found a pot to piss in
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama missin'
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama miss 'em
Uh, I'm a monster, exorcisms
Tote tools like mechanics, mechanisms
Uh, detrimental on any instrumental
I say you rappers sweet I pay the incidentals
I'm beneficial, I've been official
I say you rappers sweet, tiramisu
I like my short cake shorter
Ain't no motherfucker harder than

[Hook]
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter

[Verse 2]
Nobody gives you a chance, you gotta take chances
Your family tree, I will break branches
Cause I don't give a fuck, I put the ass in assassin
Smoke you like a blunt then it's ashes to ashes
The future is born, put the past in the casket
If real shit is dead then nigga I'm a bastard
Uh, appetite for disaster
I want a full plate then another plate after
Uh, yesterday just died
Tomorrow never cried, the days of our lives
When shit get deep I'm never afraid to dive
Let the money pile up until I'm buried alive
Ask who the fuck want it, I bring it to your doorbell
Have niggas in ya yard like a yard sale
Smoking weed, getting head in the oval office
I changed the stars on the flag into crosses

[Interlude]
Amen, so now instead of pledge, we pray, yeah

[Hook]
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter

[Verse 3]
Ya dead to me, brown grass nigga
I just stand still and let the ground pass nigga
Bullshit for lunch, brown bag nigga
Reality’s a bitch and I'mma dance with her
140 pounds, 5'6 from the ground
Bitch I'm in the building you ain't even in the lounge
I tried to fuck the world and couldn't even get aroused
I ain't looking for the beef but I ain't seen it in a while
Uh, and we all want world peace
Murder show, I give your ass good seats
Shit, I'm much more than a good speech

[Outro]
Gorillas in suits
The holy war, the spiritual troops
Fighting over the mythical truth
Drowning in the political soup
They shoot missiles and nukes
Taking out such a pivotal group
The body count is the physical proof
And they thought drugs were killing the youth, [chuckles]
Thank you, thank you all, I am President Carter

It's Good (Ft. Drake & Jadakiss)

[Intro]
You who are rich and whose troubles are few
May come around to see my point of view
What price the crown of a king on his throne
When you’re chained in the dark all alone?

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
I’m real as they come, I follow the rules
I’m still in the hood but I probably should move
Made enough money, I don’t fuck around
I just felt they needed me so I stuck around
Feds got my man, shit is real son
Cause my godson just became my real son
Think life is a game but all you get is a turn
You live and you learn, either you freeze or you burn
Kush in the air, I’m pushing the gears
Love turned into hate, hate turned into fear
If it ain't right, I don’t sign the deal
Shoot me in the watch, I got time to kill
Gasoline, propane
Ain't no salary cap in the dope game
Ain't no collective bargaining on cocaine
So in other words nigga, do your thing

[Verse 2: Drake]
Mind in one place heart in another
Please pardon my brother, he’s just angry at you niggas
Who dont have your heart in your rap shit and got too fuckin comfy
Cause we still fuckin hungry, Young Money, got the munchies
Faded, fuckin faded, aww yeah I'm fuckin faded
They tellin’ lies about me, aww yeah I must've made it
Rikers Island on this flow, 8 months for that pistol
But at least they had some bad bitches workin’ in that shit hole
Three visits later, I went and did it major
So fuck the judge, and the jury, and the litigator
Watchin all these kids who thought they had it figured out
And then November came, they let my nigga out

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Stop playin, I ain't with that bullshit
Niggas act like bitches, shanaynay, oh my goodness
This is Wayne’s world, and y’all are just some tourists
Give me three wishes, I wish, I wish, I wish, you would bitch
Brand new pussy, pussy good as baby powder
Two Glock 40′s, nigga you got 80 problems
Swimmin’ in the money, I'mma need some fuckin goggles
It's better to give, but we don't give a fuck about 'em
I just came home, shit done got real, ho
Lil Weezy-ana, the boot nigga, steel toe
I ain't workin with a full deck but I deal ho
I just touched down, kick the motherfucking field goal
Talkin ’bout baby money? I got your baby money
Kidnap your bitch, get that "how-much-you-love-your-lady" money
I know you fake nigga, press your brakes nigga
I’ll take you out, that’s a date nigga
I'm a grown ass blood, stop playin with me
Play asshole and get an ass whippin’
I think you pussy cat, ha, hello kitty
I just throw the alley-oop to Drake Griffin
I lay 'em down, tempur-pedic
This shits a game of chess, you niggas think it's cleavage
Its Young Money, yeah, tis the season
I give you the business, bitch this a business meeting
My niggas hungry, my bitches greedy
Will I die a bloody murder? Dear Mr. Ouija
Nigga, I'm straight, my girl a faggot
Potato on the barrel, pop pop potato salad

Outro (Ft. Bun B, Busta Rhymes, Nas & Shyne)

[Produced by Willy Will]

[Verse 1: Bun B]
Yeah, when I step in the spot, motherfuckers say "who that?"
Big Bun Beeda but you already knew that
Live from the state where they chop it and screw that
You hatin' on the trill OG, where they do that? (for real!)
Motherfuckers need to get off the dick, man
Fall the fuck back like a bike with no kickstand
Get out my mix, man, just gon' get you stuck
Deeper in the quicksand with no easy fix, man (damn)
No tricks, man, those is for kids
Kush in my cigar and hoes in the crib
Drank and the 20 ounce froze in the fridge
You fuckin' with P.A. so you know what it is
I'm sittin on the fours that clack
Comin' down candy in the golden 'Lac
We gettin' to the money like it's Goldman Sachs
Said we do it for the Pimp so no holding back, let's go!

[Verse 2: Nas]
Look who crept in, crept-crept in
Look-look who crept in, look-look who
L-l-l-look who crept in with automatic weapons
Reppin' QB 'til the death of him
That nigga that inspired lyrical tyrants
Like Kanye West and Em
Track record, goes back to the Essence
Smack adolescents who ask who the best is
I'm nasty like gas from a fat man's intestines
I pass it, you gaspin' for breath and you die fast
Gut 'em like a gastric bypass
But ya Nas advocates actors seem
To get typecast in the same role
Since 16 I ain't grow a day old yet my brain grow
Cocaine white Range Rov'
Tats on my body like an art exhibit
I did real good for a project nigga
Was once a Bacardi sipper
Now it's Chandon, fat blunts in the car with strippers
Guns in compartments hidden
I was real young, little youth, a novice nigga
Blessings, bowed down, respected
Chowed down, now my food's digested
Pow pow, with my shooters are Techs
That'll bust louder than the noise that I just spit
Let's get one thing straight
That my crown ain't for testin', testin'
Chop heads off like King Henry VIII
Guillotine to ya neck bitch
I'm a king in this thing, don't be dumb
Been in this shit since '91
Niggas can't fuck with the style I use
Your fate is sealed, no Heidi Klum
Calm now, was a wylin' dude
Studied taoism and made power moves
Watched "Wild Planet", seen lions devour food
You can say that's how I move
A monster nigga, and I don't really like doing songs with niggas
There go my nigga Wayne
Let them niggas hate, or like my nigga Drake say
"We ain't got time to respond to niggas"

[Verse 3: Shyne]
I'm a villain, I'm a villain, all that happens in the street
Poverty and desperation made me everything I be
I'm a shotta when I pop up with them poppers, burn ya block up
Call the judges, call the coppers, we takin' over Gotham
Word to Poppa, Blood, Bl-Blood gang, five
It’s that Blood gang five but green is the bottom line
I run this town, I ain't gon' lie, they run they mouth, they ain't gon' fire
They actin' like they ain’t gon' die, until I let them 'llamas fly
Flatbush to Bed Do-or-Die, from Watts to Larry Hoover Chi
Poverty and heroine, it’s no place for a juvenile
Put greed in our heart, it’s the green that we want
Cash Money is the company and Weezy the boss!

[Verse 4: Busta Rhymes]
They say I’m underrated, but un-compete-with-able
Understandable, being that my rating levels are unreachable
Anything said other than that should be silenced, unspeakable!
And the thought of you being nicer than me, unfeasible!
They ask is what I do ever gonna stop, this shit will never end
That’s when you hear a car crash in the vocal booth
Got 'em sayin' "There he goes again!"
See now they nominated a nigga to come
And flatten everything now let me dominate it, nigga run
And they be knowin' that I be blackin' on everything
And make it complicated like a nigga constipated with a gun
I gotta make it what they want and wake ‘em when I come
And shake 'em and bake 'em and take 'em to another place
Ain’t no fakin’, ain’t no kind of mistakin' how I be breakin' up
Everything and be creating a s-s-s-situation when I'm done (damn!)
You see I spit National Treasure, discography rich
And I done killed more cats than curiosity, snitch!
Most of you niggas sorry and owe apologies, quick
What the fuck you niggas still hangin' around here for, you apostrophe bitch?
Okay, now enough of that, see now I’m out the door
Tunechi, thanks for giving us a whole 'nother classic with "Tha Carter IV"

I Like the View

[Hook]
I stepped on a flower, foot on a petal
Good wasn't home so I settled for better
I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot
So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got
Now I'm like "Hey, I like the view from here!"
I'm so high I can't see you from here
Both eyes on the money, it's looking back at me
Man, these bitches just looking for a daddy
Pussy and problems, can't live without 'em
The weed too loud, turn up the volume
Richer than a bitch, but I can't buy tomorrow
That's why I go hard, ho

[Verse 1]
God bless the world, and most people in it
It's anybody's game, but nobody's winning
Mona Lisa smile, that bitch barely grinning
Take you off the face of the Earth like a blemish
We wen't from Boyz to Menace, Menace II Society
Now we get higher, call that shit karate
Blame it on the money, the money is the bad guy
Smoke so much good, I don't even have a bad side
Yeah, I got a pussy hangover
Bitches eat me up like my name is Russell Stover
Murder the perception, make 'em get it right
If I'm flirting with perfection, I'm fucking her tonight
I'm a Southerner's delight, Louisiana pride
The belly of the beast, it ate me alive
Tell them bitches they'll never take me alive
And today I took a walk outside and...

[Hook]
I stepped on a flower, foot on a petal
Good wasn't home so I settled for better
I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot
So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got
Now I'm like "Hey, I like the view from here!"
I'm so high I can't see you from here
Both eyes on the money, it's looking back at me
Man, these bitches just looking for a daddy
Pussy and problems, can't live without 'em
The weed too loud, turn up the volume
Richer than a bitch, but I can't buy tomorrow
That's why I go hard, ho

[Verse 2]
Uh, and we all kiss our mamas
Cause promises are broken but tomorrow isn't promised
Think I'm gettin' sick, I'm feelin' illegal
And not having money is the root of all evil
Life is a midget, so try to live it up
It's Dr. Carter, bitch, I got this shit nipped and tucked
If these walls could talk, they probably won't shut up
I need some wallpaper before they start to fuss
Yeah, pick up the phone and call your bluff
Human growth hormone, now my pockets all buff
I don't think about the future, it comes soon enough
Motherfucker, I don't shoot ya; bitch, I shoot ya up
I ain't like these niggas, I don't like these niggas
I just roll another joint, like Spike Lee, nigga
And I woke up this morning, got the coal out my eyes
And then I took a walk outside and...

[Hook]
I stepped on a flower, foot on a petal
Good wasn't home so I settled for better
I'm on my way to get it, but get it got shot
So I guess I gotta work with the little bit I got
Now I'm like "Hey, I like the view from here!"
I'm so high I can't see you from here
Both eyes on the money, it's looking back at me
Man, these bitches just looking for a daddy
Pussy and problems, can't live without 'em
The weed too loud, turn up the volume
Richer than a bitch, but I can't buy tomorrow
That's why I go hard, ho

Mirror (Ft. Bruno Mars)

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
With everything happening today
You don't know whether you're coming or going
But you think that you're on your way
Life lined up on the mirror don't blow it

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Look at me when I'm talking to you
You looking at me but I'm looking through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love in disguise
I see the pain hidden in your pride
I see you're not satisfied
And I don't see nobody else
I see myself, I'm looking at the..

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall, you've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talking to each other again

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you're all alone
And you correct me when I'm looking wrong
I see that guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window pane
I see the scars that remain
I see Wayne, I'm lookin' at the..

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall, you've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talking to each other again

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Looking at me now I can see my past
Damn, I look just like my fucking dad
Light it up, that's smoke and mirrors
I even look good in the broken mirror
I see my mama smile, that's a blessing
I see the change, I see the message
And no message coulda been any clearer
So I'm starting with the man in the..

[Chorus: Bruno Mars & Lil Wayne]
Mirror on the wall, here we are again
MJ taught me that
Through my rise and fall, you've been my only friend
Take 'em to Mars, man
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talking to each other again
Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall, you've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talking to each other again

[Outro]
Hey B.P., looks like I did take 'em to Mars this time?
So why are we, talking to each other again...

Two Shots

[Produced by Diplo & DJA]

[Hook]
Two shots of whatever, two shots of whatever
It's like tug-of-war, tryna pull myself together
I could probably do better, but probably's like never
I'm a pimp under pressure, leave my money on the dresser

[Verse 1]
Goons in this bitch, leave a nigga on a stretcher
It's all there papa, you ain't even got to measure
Laughing at how my old bitches look jealous
Well what goes around comes around, propellers
Money Over Bitches, M.O.B, goodfellas
Cut our ears off, ain't shit you could tell us
Write your name on the bullet, that's a fuckin' love letter
If I ain't a trendin' topic, I'm a fuckin' trend-setter, I'm on

[Hook]
Two shots of whatever, two shots of whatever
Man, it's like tug-of-war, tryna pull myself together
I could probably do better, but probably's like never
I'm a pimp under pressure, leave my money on the dresser

[Verse 2]
If you're scared, go to church, Mason Betha
Sometimes the paper chase could be like chasin' a leopard
The pussy wetter, wetter than it's ever been
But she gone probably try to cross the line like a Mexican
I ain't on that bullshit, shorty fine as fuck though
Now she kiss me on my neck, I hope she ain't cut-throat
Cut down on the syrup cause it made me fuck slow
Shoot so many times I'mma choke off the gunsmoke
Life, death, love, hate, pleasure, pain
Pay me no mind but I don't have change
I cock back and aim at your membrane
Broad day, no mask, close range

[Bridge]
You can get two shots from wherever, two shots from whoever
It be like a puzzle tryna put you back together
I should probably do better but probably, whatever

[Verse 3]
Your bullshit is stinkin' up the place
Me no tek bad up, me a done de place
Can't let these bitch niggas slide and touch base
I make her cum so many times, call her "nutcase"
It's Young Money baby, take your clothes off
Give me them three holes, bowlin' ball
Two shots of whatever
Keep them bitches cummin' and she gon' do whatever

[Hook]
Two shots of whatever, two shots of whatever
It's like tug-of-war, tryna pull myself together
I could probably do better, but probably's like never
I'm a pimp under pressure, leave my money on the dresser

[Outro]
Two shots of whatever, two shots of whatever

Up Up and Away

[Intro]
Up up and away
Up up and away
Up, up up and away
Up, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm about to go, up up and away
Dick in your mouth, fuck what you say
You sweet as pie, a muffin or cake
Dick in her mouth, I'm fuckin' her face
Live for the night, sleep in the day
Get high as fuck, sleep it away
I am a dog, you sheep in the gate
Pussy, mmm, how sweet is the taste
Gun to your head, what you keep in the safe?
Weezy, bitch, I'm deeper than space
Floating away like a leaf on the lake
I'm gone, like delete and erase
Talk that shit, I walk that shit
Pills, weed, all that shit
If the bitch is bad, I'mma call that bitch
Get pussy, ass, all that shit
Umh, what they talking about?
I go hard, they soft as a couch
I'm running 'em in and walking 'em out
Cars so cold I parked in the house
Flows so raw, this beat is pregnant
Flow so tight, it's yeast infected
Kill 'em all when they least expect it
Money tall, Lisa Leslie
YMCMB connection
Rappers is what I eat for breakfast
Woman up in my sheets is sexy
If she ain't fucking, she can exit
Gun tucked in the waist, I'll bust in ya face
I ain't got nothing to say, but up up and away

[Hook]
Up up and away, up up and away
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days
Up up and away, up up and away
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days

[Interlude]
Weezy (Yeah) Where ya going? (Up)
You're going a little bit too far

[Verse 2]
Ain't this a bitch
I just saw my bitch kiss a bitch
You're lucky I don't kill your ass
But you can still get pistol whipped
Sharper than a pencil tip
Bitch don't even fix your lip
40 cal' with the extended clip
Ain't gon' be no incident
Skinny jeans, red Vans
Skully on, money long
Her mouth is like my house
So I guess you can say I'm coming home
You're wyling out then we're riding out
Now your hiding out, honeycomb
I'm laughing to the bank
Like I just broke my fucking funny bone
What's really good five?
I'm over here smoking that really good fire
Eyes so low I look blind
But the stove on my waist cook fine
I be with niggas that took lives
And niggas that'll take it outside
And niggas that'll take it to your crib
Take the baby out the crib and rape housewives
I'm gon' get so wasted
They gon' have to carry me out this bitch
I took over this rap shit
These rappers are just my hostages
Let's cut to the chase, my bitch no habla ingles
But I ain't got nothing to say, but up up and away

[Hook]
Up up and away, up up and away
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days
Up up and away, up up and away
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days

[Interlude]
Weezy (Yeah) Where you going? (Ha)
You're going a little bit too far (Up up and away)
Up up and away (Up up and away)
Up up and away (Up up and away)
Up up and away

[Verse 3]
Fuck with a nigga, if you fuck with a nigga
Fuck with me, good luck to the nigga
Straps on deck, so fuck that nigga
Leave you looking like lightning struck that nigga
Racks on deck, I'm rich as shit
I'm calling my bitch the shit
Walking around on my fuck it shit
I done did everything on my bucket list
Fuck that shit, I'm Superbad
I don't give a Hoover damn
Man, I son all these niggas
They should have a stupid tan
Ha, President Carter, vote for Lil Wayne
Sit your five dollar ass down 'fore I make change
I'm pumping your brakes, I'm jumping the gates
And I ain't got nothing to say, but up up and away

[Interlude]
Weezy, where you going?
You're going a little bit too far
(Up up and away)

[Outro]
Up up and away (Up up and away)
Up up and away (Up up and away)
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days
Come here, I might need you
You're gonna have to tickle me or something
I need to smoke a cigarette

Novacane (Ft. Kevin Rudolf)

[Snippet]
Raindrops from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
Hummingbirds do fly

[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
Ooh girl, I love you so
Good lord almighty, I’m in love with a whitey
I call her Aphrodite, I call her when I need her
And she give me good love til my nose start bleeding
Life is just like moving mountains
When I can’t cope, I’m hittin’ that slope
That great white hope, and it ain't no pressure
I can’t feel nothing, but I never felt better
Hmm, but you were just no good for me
Killin’ me softly, that girl is poison
Huh, I had to let you go, take things slow
Just so you know

[Hook: Kevin Rudolf]
I’ll do it all again if I had the chance
Don’t feel the pain (don’t feel the pain)
Like novacane (like novacane)
I’ll take the whole world on, I’m feeling so strong
Don’t feel the pain (don’t feel the pain)
Like novacane (like novacane)
Like novacane

[Verse 2: Lil' Wayne]
You used to make me feel so good
Like I was on top of the World
Sorry I gotta stay away from ya
But that's what the doctor prefered
My Friends told me leave you alone
And I just told 'em leave me alone
It's sad our thing had to end
The relationship was short and sweet, Nia Long
And I see her in the streets
But I can't bring her home
Man, I was on her line all day, no phone
Hah. No Arm & Hammer in my Tony Montana
And truth is...

[Hook: Kevin Rudolf]

[Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]
Sweet sugar hill, yeah I used to climb her
I never imagined she'd turn out to be but a cheap thrill
That sweet turned to sour, she gave me power
The world was ours
I used to feel invincible on that flour
But I had to change, Yeah, I had to change
So I left it for a bitch named Mary Jane
Now everything's cool, everything's fine
Girl, I'm moving on, I left you behind
Every now and then you pop up on my mind
I might fuck you one last time, cause

You gon' need a space shuttle or a ladder that's forever
However, I'm better, if not now, then never
Don't you ever fix your lips unless you 'bout to suck my dick
Bitch, swallow my words, taste my thoughts
And if it's too nasty, spit it back at me
Two more inches, I'd have been in that casket
According to the doctor, I could've died in traffic

And sure enough, I got Miss Cita in a better place
When I was 14, I told my mom we will see better days
And sure enough, we did exactly what I said

Cause if another girl could, she gonna fuck me good"
No sitting at the table if you bringing nothing to it

[Hook: Sha-Ron Prescott & Lil Wayne]
Hey, Mr. Carter (Hello)

Hey, Mr. Carter (Hey, hello)
Tell me, where have you been? (Shit, you know)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (Hahahah)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, to you forever, from me to you
I heard somebody say "Church", I'ma need a suit
I'ma need a coupe, I won't need a roof
Flyer than Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice
I got the flow, I'm tryin' to see the roof
Didn't wear a bulletproof so I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do?
But I'ma leave it to God, not Beaver, neither you
Cause I'ma murder Y, kill O, and even U
Man, I got Summer hatin' on me cause I'm hotter than the Sun
Got Spring hatin' on me 'cause I ain't never sprung
Winter hatin' on me 'cause I'm colder than y'all
And I will never, I will never, I will never Fall
I'm being hated by the seasons
So fuck y'all who hatin' for no reason

[Hook: Sha-Ron Prescott & Lil Wayne]
Hey, Mr. Carter (I am him!)
Tell me, where have you been?
Around the world and I'm back again!
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
Who's been askin' about me?
They've been wondering why (In case you wonderin', hah!)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, I been in and out the bank, bitch
While y'all asshole niggas been on the same shit
I flush and watch 'em go down the drain quick
Two words you never hear: "Wayne quit!?"
Cause Wayne win, and they lose
I call them April babies, cause they fools
And when they snooze, we up!
Feet up, like a paraplegia
Or paraplegic? I parallel park
In that red-and-yellow thing; old school Atlanta Hawk
Like I'm from College Park, but I'm from Hollygrove
Now all my Bloods scream "Soo-woo" and "Da-da-doe"
I know my role and I play it well
And I weigh it well, on my Libra scale
I suck a pussy, fuck a pussy, leave it there
Long hair, don't even care

[Hook: Sha-ron Prescott & Jay-Z]
Hey, Mr. Carter (Young! I am him)
Tell me, where have you been?
Around the world now I'm back again

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
I'm right here in my chair with my crown and my dear
Queen B, as I share, mic time with my heir
Young Carter, go farther, go further, go harder
Is that not why we came? And if not, then why bother?
Show no mercy in Murcielagos
I'm far from bein' the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my name's been mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggies and the Pacs and the Marleys and the Marcuses
Garvey; got me a molotov-cocktail flow
Even if you box well, can't stop the blows
Kaboom! The Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy I just came off the spoon
Also, I'm so fly I'm on auto-
Pilot, while guys just stare at my wardrobe
I see Euros, that's right: plural
I took so much change from this rap game, it's your go
(Hey Mr. Carter) Young!

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
It's my go, yeah… And I'ma go so opposite of soft
Off the richter, Hector, Camacho Man, Randy Savage
Far from average, above status–quo, flow so pro
I know, I ride slow, and when I pass
They say, "What up, killa?" Man, stop bringin' up my past
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie, or Jay-Z
Don't forget Weezy, baby!

[Hook: Sha-Ron Prescott, Lil Wayne & Choir]
Hey, Mr. Carter (Amen)
Tell me, where have you been? (Yeah)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (Haha)
Hey, Mr. Carter (Amen)
Tell me, where have you been? (Hova!)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching (Weezy)
They've been wondering why (Baby!)
Hey, Mr. Carter (Hahaha)
Tell me, where have you been? (I been hustlin')
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching (Hustlin' hard)
They've been wondering why (Chyeah!)
Hey, Mr. Carter
Tell me, where have you been?
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
And I swear to everything, when I leave this Earth
It's gonna be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
And you can try me, fucker, but when I squeeze, it hurt
Fine, we'll lose two lives; yours and mine
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve
At the funeral parlor, drippin' tears down my sleeve
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve

A Milli

[Intro]
Bangladesh
Young Money!
You dig?
Mack, I'm going in

[Verse 1]
A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual, bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
‘Cause I don't write shit, ‘cause I ain't got time
‘Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers: "Ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch him, you can't stop him"
I go by them goon rules: if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em ‘cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

[Hook]
Motherfucker, I'm ill

[Verse 2]
A million here, a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair, with coke in her derriere
Like smoke in the thinnest air
I open the Lamborghini, hopin' them crackers see me
Like, "Look at that bastard Weezy!"
He's a beast, he's a dog, he's a mothafuckin' problem
Okay, you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothin', nothin', you ain't scarin' nothin'
On some faggot bullshit: call 'em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want, bitch! Call me on my Sidekick!
Never answer when it's private, damn, I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch
And she ain't shy no more: she changed her name to My Bitch
Yeah, nigga, that's my bitch, so when she ask
For the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch!
And it ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass: you ain't got shit
Motherfucker, I'm ill, not sick
And I'm okay, but my watch sick, yeah, my drop sick
Yeah, my Glock sick, and my knot thick — I'm it

[Hook]
Motherfucker, I'm ill

[Verse 3]
See, they say I'm rappin' like B.I.G., Jay, and 2Pac
André 3000, where is Erykah Badu at? Who that?
Who that said they gon' beat Lil Wayne?
My name ain't Bic, but I keep that flame, man
Who that one that do that, boy?
You knew that true that, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen sharin' showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy, I got so many bitches, like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucker, I say "Life ain't shit without me"
Chrome lips pokin' out the coupe, look like it's poutin'
I do what I do, and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain — dare me
Don't you compare me, ‘cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they hear me
They don't feel me but they fear me
I'm illy, C3, 3 Peat

For granted, cause granted, my love for you is real
And if you don't love me, somebody else will
Baby girl don't you, ever, get too, comfortable
(Comfortable, comfortable, comfortable)

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Word to God, my momma gon' like this one, yeah
Yo, I think everybody gonna like this one, yeah, I got one
Thank you, Mr. West! Carter! Tre!
I'm out

Dr. Carter

[Intro: Lil Wayne & Nurse]
Wheres my coffee?
Good morning Dr. Carter (Hey sweetie)
Looks like it's gonna be a long day
Ahh, another one huh? What we got
Your first patient (Yeah)
Is suffering from a lack of concepts (Uh-huh)
Originality (Ugghh)
His flow is weak (Another one)
And he has no style (Ughhh)
What you got for him? (Tssss, okay)

[Verse 1]
Let me put my gloves on, and my scrubs on
Dr. Carter to the rescue
Excuse me if I'm late, but like a thief it takes
Time to be this great, uhh, so just wait
Your style is a disgrace, your rhymes are fifth place
And I'm just grace, one, uno, ace
And I'm trying make your heart beat like bass
Hmm-mm, but you're sweet like cake
And I come to fix whatever you shall break
Where is your originality? You are so fake
So picture me like a gallery, capture what I say
All I need is one mic, all I need is one take
Like, hey! Brighter than a sun ray
Got a pistol on a playground, watch the gun-play
Like, no kidding, no kids in the way
But the kids do watch, gotta watch what we say
Gotta work everyday, gotta not be cliché
Gotta stand out like Andre 3K
Gotta kick it, kick it like a sensei
You gotta have faith, you gottta, gotta
Wait, wait, I think I, I think I lost him
(Flatline)

[Interlude: Lil Wayne & Nurse]
Good afternoon Dr. Carter (Nurse)
I don't know about this one
His confidence is down
Vocab and metaphors needs work
And he lacks respect for the game (Uhhhh, let me see)
You think you can save him?

[Verse 2]
Okay, respect is in the heart, so that's where I'mma start
And a lot of heart patients don't make it
But, hey kid, plural, I graduated
'Cause you can get through anything if Magic made it
And that was called recycling, r-e-reciting something
'Cause you just like it so you say it just like it
Some say it's biting but I say it's enlightening
Besides, Dr. Kanye West is one of the brightest
And Dr. Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest
And Dr. Jeezy can fix you back up the nicest
Arthritis in my hand from writing
But I'm a doctor, they don't understand my writing
So I stopped writing, now I'm like lightning
And you ain't Vince Young so don't clash with the Titan
Fast and exciting, my passion is frightening
Now let me put some more vocab in your IV
Here, take this Vicodin, like it and love it
And confidence has no budget
So pay me no mind, I don't walk it like I talk it 'cause I run it
I don't do it 'cause I done it, and I'm in the emergency un-it
God dunnit I've lost another one
(Flatline)

[Interlude: Lil Wayne & Nurse]
Good evening Dr. Carter, it's been a long day
But this one looks much better than the others
His respect is back up, concepts sound good
His style is showing strong signs of improvement
All he needs now is his swagger
Okay, let me take my gloves off then

[Verse 3]
Swagger tighter than a yeast infection
Fly, go hard, like geese, erection
Fashion patrol, police detection
Eyes stay tight like Chinese Connection
I stay tight like pussy at night
Baby, don't get me wrong, I could do that pussy right
But I'm too wrong to right, too fresh to fight
Too paid to freestyle, too paid to freestyle
Had to say it twice, swagger so nice
And don't ask me shit unless it concern a price
And I don't rap fast, I rap slow
'Cause I mean every letter in the words
In the sentence of my quotes
Swagger just flows sweeter than honey oats
That swagger, I got it, I wear it like a coat
Wait, as I put the light down his throat
I can only see flow, his blood starting to flow
His lungs starting to grow, this one's starting to show
Strong signs of life, where's the stitches? Here's the knife
Smack his face, his eyes open, I reply, "What a night"
"Welcome back, Hip Hop — I saved your life"

[Outro: Nurse]
He looks good, his vitals are up
He's looking good, he's looking good
I think we got one, Dr. Carter, I think we got one
Yep, yep, we got one, we saved him he's good
He's good, we got one, he's good
(Heartbeat)
He's good, we got him
We saved him, he's a go
He's good

Phone Home

[Intro: Dre]
This is, this is, this is, this is
We are not the same, I am a Martian
We are not the same, I am a Martian
Greetings from Planet Weezy
We will begin transmission in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

[Hook: Dre]
Phone home! Weezy

And if you feel like you're the best
Go 'head and do the Weezy-We, and
Phone home! Weezy
Phone home! Weezy

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
We are not the same, I am a Martian
And I'm hotter than summer rain like Carl Thomas
Lock, load, ready to aim at any target
I could get your brains for a bargain like I bought it from Target
Hip hop is my supermarket
Shopping cart full of fake hip hop artists
I'm starving, sorry, I gotta eat all it
And I'll be back in the morning

[Hook: Dre]
Phone home! Weezy
Phone home! Weezy
Phone home! Weezy
Phone home! Weezy
And if you feel like you're the best
Go 'head and do the Weezy-We, and
Phone home! Weezy

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
We are not the same, I am a alien
Like Gonzales, young college
Student, who done just flipped the game like Houston
I'm used to promethazine in two cups, I'm screwed up
And you ain't shit if you ain't never been screwed up
Flow so sick make you wanna throw your food up
Ice water chest, and my wrist like a cool cup
Two twin clippers, I give your ass a crew cut
I get bread like cold cuts, you know what?
Your girl go down fast, come up slow, but I never slow up
Weezy!

[Hook: Dre]
Phone home! Weezy
Phone home! Weezy
Phone home! Weezy
Phone home! Weezy
And if you feel like you're the best
Go 'head and do the Weezy-We, and
Phone home! Weezy
Phone home! Weezy

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
They don't make 'em like me no more
Matter of fact, they never made it like me before
I'm rare, like Mr. Clean with hair
No brake lights on my car rear
I never had life and I never had fear
I rap like I done died and gone to heaven, I swear
And yeah, I'm a bear, like black and white hair, so I'm polar
And they can't get on my system 'cause my system is the solar
I am so far from the othars, I meant others
I just eat them for supper, get in my spaceship and hover, hover

[Hook: Dre]
Phone home! Weezy
Phone home! Weezy
Phone home! Weezy
Phone home! Weezy
And if you feel like you're the best
Go 'head and do the Weezy-We, and
Phone home! Weezy
Phone home! Weezy

Tie My Hands (Ft. Robin Thicke)

[Produced by Robin Thicke]

[Intro: Robin Thicke]
We are at war with the universe
The sky is falling and the only thing that can save us now
Is sensitivity and compassion
Da da da, da-da-da, da da da
Da da da, da-da-da, da da da, ooohh
But I know one thing's for sure
I'm gonna get my kicks before it all burns down

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, some say tragedy's hard to get over
But sometimes that tragedy means it's over
Soldier, from the academy league of rollers
I deny being down though they seem to hold us
My shoulders are strong, I prove 'em wrong
I ain't doing nothing but moving on, let the truth be known
But they talked that freedom at us
And didn't even leave a ladder, damn

[Verse 2: Robin Thicke]
I work at the corner store
We all got problems, problems
No one's gonna fly down low
No one's gonna save us now
How you feel you're not alone
We're all just jealous, jealous
We don't reach the sky no more
We just can't overcome, no

[Hook: Robin Thicke]
You tie my hands, what am I gonna be?
What have I done so bad? What is my destiny?
You tie my hands, what am I suppose to see?
What have I done so bad? What am I gonna be?

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I, knock on the door, hope isn't home
Fate's not around, the luck's all gone
Don't ask me what's wrong, ask me what's right
And I'mma tell you what's life, and did you know
I lost everything, but I ain't the only the one
First came the hurricane, then the morning sun
Excuse me if I'm on one
And don't trip if I light one, I walk a tight one
They tryna tell me keep my eyes open
My whole city underwater, some people still floating
And they wonder why black people still voting
Cause your president still choking
Take away the football team, the basketball team
And all we got is me to represent New Orleans, shit
No governor, no help from the mayor
Just a steady beating heart and a wish and a prayer
Let's pray

[Verse 4: Robin Thicke]
These friends they come and go
But I got family, family
These kids so fast they grow
They learn so quickly now
That there's nowhere to go
That there's no future, future
Don't make this here so low
And we can't overcome, no

[Hook: Robin Thicke]
You tie my hands, what am I gonna be?
What have I done so bad? What is my destiny?
You tie my hands, what am I suppose to see?
What have I done so bad? What am I gonna be?

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, and if you come from under that water then there's fresh air
Just breathe, baby, God's got a blessing to spare
Yes I know the process is so much stress
But it's the progress that feels the best
Cause I came from the projects straight to success
And you're next, so try they can't steal your pride, it's inside
Then find it and keep on grinding
Cause in every dark cloud, there's a silver lining, I know

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
See right now we just riding on love
A shot in the dark
We ain't tryin to do nothing but hit the heart
We need love
That's all y'all, that's all

[Hook: Robin Thicke]
You tie my hands, what am I gonna be?
What have I done so bad? What is my destiny?
You tie my hands, what am I suppose to see?
What have I done so bad? What am I gonna be?
You tie my hands, what am I gonna be?
What have I done so bad? What is my destiny?
You tie my hands, what am I suppose to see?
What have I done so bad? What am I gonna be?

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, born right here in the USA
But due to tragedy looked on by the whole world as a refugee
So accept my emotion
Do not take it as an offensive gesture
It's just the epitome of my soul and I must be me
We got spirit y'all, we got spirit
We got soul y'all, we got soul
They don't want us to see, but we already know

[Intro]
Yeah, I see you big bro
I'mma kill these niggas man, yeah

[Verse 1]
Straight off the block with it
Eagle Street to be specific
I'm peeping at you people different
I pay my dues, you keep the difference
I can see the end in the beginning
So I'm not racing, I'm just sprinting
'Cause I don't wanna finish
They diminish
I replenish
Scientific
I'm out this world, ho
I wear bright red, like a girl toe
No homo
Fingernails dirty
I've been counting dirty money since 12:30
A.M
Weigh them
If they short, take them
Right back and spray him
Amen
Yeah, I just do my Wayne
And every time I do it, I do my thang
Yeah, believe that, like a true story
Rims big, make the car look like it's two stories
If I hop out, that'd be suicide
No back seats, call that paralyze
I don't have a spine
I don't fantasize
I mastermind
Then go after mine
You see I handle mine
I dismantle mine
I tote a tool box, bitch it's hammer time
So excuse me as I nail 'em to something
I'm just repel 'em
I'mma kill 'em
Someone tell 'em
I'mma kill 'em
I'm gon' fill 'em up
His momma can't tell 'em
And the doctors can't heal 'em
I'mma kill 'em
And yeah we sell 'em
I know you smell 'em
And if you want it, you could just yell it
And it be in the morning, at your 'telly
Whole ki go for twenty
Half a ki go for eleven

I Am Legend

Weezy Baby on the mic, D.O.A
OK, I'd like to thank Kanye
And my nigga Deezle
From giving me this Diesel
Like an F-350
Tank never empty
Damn everybody in the bank act friendly
Used to think my shit didn't stink, boy was I wrong
Approving million dollar deals from my iPhone
I'mma take it one-two-way back
Like a silk wife beater and a wave cap
Or the wave pool
At Blue Bayou
And I waved, fool
As I blew by you
Hello, hi you
I can buy you
But I wouldn't try you
Feed you to Piru
I know what I'm doing
I show and prove
And show improvement
And I know just to go into it
Could never amount to going through it
Whatever, how you wanna do it
We can do it like we late
Ay, wait
Deezle, let me just get the 808
As I hit the kill switch
Now that's how you let the beat build, bitch

Damn

Like a fucking ram
On the hunt for the lamb
I'mma dump 'em, man
In a dumpster can
You ain't a soldier, ask Uncle Sam
Hair nappy like Pam
Nigga fuck your plan
Fuck your man
You ain't a pimp unless you get the same bitch
To fuck your man
And fuck your clan
And all my bitches know that's my plan
Oh god damn
There's my sam–ple
Play it like that's my band
Gotta get it cleared
Suck my dick with red lipstick and don't let it smear
And I got a lot of tattoos, and I meant every tear
And I'm still on that street shit
Back to the beat bitch

Open up your hearts people
Page one, chapter one
Verse motherfucking one
Yeah, uh-huh
I'm drinking hot tea bitch, feel me

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, now if you let me, you won't regret me
Shit, if you let me, you won't forget me
Remember? And if you don't then ponder
Hold up, pow-pow, there's a reminder
I ain't kinda hot, I'm sauna
I sweat money, and the bank is my shower
Haha, and that pistol is my towel
Haha, so stop sweating me coward
And I would, die for ours
Ride for hours, supply the flowers
This is history in the making
Now shut the fuck up and let me make it

[Hook: D. Smith & (Lil Wayne)]
Please don't shoot me down, 'cause I'm flying
I'm flying, I'm higher
Please don't shoot me down
'Cause I'm flying, I'm higher
(I swear this tea is at a real good temperature right now
So am I, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I spit Alcatraz bars, I know
And D-boys is the only Alphabet Boys I know
Got a .380 on my waist and Rambo back home
No more bandana 'round my dome, bandana in my right pocket
Bitch I'm grown, fuck what you on
Now watch me stand on the world as I sit in a throne
And if I jump, I'mma fly and look into the eagle's eye
And see I am nothing like you, why?
Bitch, see, it gets me how nothing gets me or get to me
And if you shootin' for the stars then just shoot me
But your bullets don't reach Mars
Paws, claws, because, I'm a beast, I'm a dog
I'll getcha, my picture should be in the dictionary
Next to the definition of "Definition"
Because repetition is the father of learnin'
And son, I know your barrel burnin', but

[Hook: D. Smith]
Please don't shoot me down, 'cause I'm flying
I'm flying, I'm higher
Please don't shoot me down
'Cause I'm flying, I'm higher

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Hey, talk to my daddy
Papa, I did it to 'em! I'm a bastard!
And I'ma do it again, like nigga backwards
These niggas backwards, but they behind us
Now watch me get high like time's up
Nah D, bring the drums back
And watch me hit 'em where they lungs at, like that
I get respect 'cause if I don't I'mma take it
I see your boys hatin' and I see your girls naked
Drum, sound like a naked gun, switch clips with my thumb
Then I pop another clip in, and aim at his vision
'Cause Wayne is his vision, 'cause Wayne is the mission
I'm aiming at a mirror

[Hook: D. Smith & Lil Wayne]
Please don't shoot me down, 'cause I'm flying
I'm flying, I'm higher
And I've done it before
Please don't make me do it no more
Please don't shoot me down
'Cause I'm flying, I'm higher
Watch me soar
Where the fuck is my guitar? Now roar
Ohhhhhhhhhh
Please don't shoot me down, 'cause I'm flying
I'm flying, I'm higher

La La (Ft. Brisco & Busta Rhymes)

[Intro]
David-David-David-David-David Banner

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Sittin' in a Caddy, Wright like Betty
Floatin' up the aisle like the bride and her Daddy
Hip-hop addict, hip-hop addict
Man I swear I'm on top like the attic
Yeah, bitch, I be with my dog like Shaggy
And we stay clean but we get dirty like Harry
Flyer than blue birds, cardinals and canaries
Fuck we, I'm all about "oui" like Paris
Hilton presidential suite already
I'm richer than Nicole and I'm a lion like her daddy
I am hotter than the Sun-day after Saturday
I swear I'm a savage like Lil Webbie and Randy
Oscar De La Hoya, box ya like a casket
Or Diego Coralles, nigga keep jabbin'
See, my style it varies, like drugs in an alley
My leather so soft, my paint prettier than Halle
Wittier than comedy, nigga write a parody
But I ain't tellin' jokes... apparently
A parent, yeah my daughter be the twinkle of my eye
You hurt her, you kill me, and nigga I ain't 'bout to die
See y'all are at ground, and my daughter is my sky
I swear I look in her face and I just want to break out and fly
Four tears in my face and you ain't never heard me cry
I'm richer than all y'all, I got a bank full of pride
Oww!

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet
Started with my girlfriend, ended with her homies
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet

[Verse 2: Brisco]
My paint Bubblicious, the motor so vicious
The rims the same color as the wrapper of a Kisses
Hershey's, I'm hyphy, somethin' like a piston
And when I'm in Detroit, I be ballin' like a Piston
Oh, and did I mention? I'm fly like a pigeon
Higher than gas prices, you Las Vegas trickin'
I'm nine under par in a Bentley golf cart
The Polo be cream but the Prada's caviar
Weezy, I'm sick from all this tourin'
He told me, "Sip this, and call me in the morning"
Yeah, and I vowed to never trust another woman
In my life, then I got horny

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet
Started with my girlfriend, ended with her homies

Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
See I ain't goin' nowhere, bitch, you know a nigga been home, honey
Money fuckin' retarded, call it Down Syndrome money
My case sick, shit, they diagnose sickle cell bread
The revenue stream got a disease like a jail bed
Like a mattress from Sing-Sing or way down in Comstock
These bitches call me Bling King, I shit when the bomb drop
And sprinkle diamonds all over niggas, flawless and D-Class
Then twinkle like a shine, just like a sparkle from clean glass
They movin' on a nigga as I'm walkin' the valley, ready
And zoomin' with the cameras like I'm dickin' down Halle Berry
My money help me do things that you niggas can't believe
Like purchase persons, places all them things that you can't conceive
Like interactin' with women the caliber of Janet
I sit and master my vision and massacre the planet (Whoa!)
I hope you niggas know just what it is
While I'm countin' my paper, niggas know I'm handlin' my biz
(Okay)

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet
Started with my girlfriend, ended with her homies
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet

Street fi-di-di-di-damn

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I'm with 101 niggas, we dalmatian doggy deep (yes)
And fly with the tongue, so if you feeling froggy, leap (c'mon)
Kermit, you better think before you ribbit
Don't get murdered over your song before you ad-lib it
I pop up like Xzibit, but given I'm at your crib, it's
Not to put no fucking fish tanks in your Civic
Fuck getting your ride pimped, you'll get hog-tied, wimp
Have you in the trunk curled up like fried shrimp
It's been a good year, maybe I should ride blimp
Cause your boy just stay above the game
They tryna tag him, spray a brother frame
But your shots can't reach me, I'm way above your aim
Go 'head, nigga, say another name
Take this family for a joke, play them Wayan brother games
And I'ma Git You Sucka, I be schemin' with this Keenan
Aimin with this Damon, I'm putting that Major Payne in
My Little Man is on ya, Marlon and Shawn ya
Lay the beef on his noodle, make some Luger lasagna
Forty Cal fettuccine, trey pound pasta
You reach for this medallion, you must like Italian, nigga
You only see me pushing if the driver's tired (yes!)
I work the S6 ever since the 5 retired
The drop-top, they say it's Ocean Drive-inspired
So you can call a cab once your bitch fall for Fab

[Hook: Lil' Wayne]
Uhh, I'm gettin' money like a muhfucka

Dontgetit

[Intro: Nina Simone]
Baby, you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong you see some bad

[Hook: Nina Simone]
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, what’s understood ain’t gotta be explained
But you don't understand me, so let me explain
Stood in the heat, the flame
The snow, please, slow down, hurricane
The wind blow, my dreads swang
He had hair like wool, like Wayne
Huh, dropping ashes in the Bible
I shake 'em out and they fall on the rifle
Scary, Hail Mary, no tale-fairy
All real, very extraordinary
Perry Mason facin' the barrel if he tattle
My God is my judge; no gown, no gavel
A hound, a rebel, down to battle
Now or never or whenever
And the F for "Fucking fantastic", fuck if you agree
I'm bright, but I don't give a fuck if you see me

[Hook: Nina Simone]
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
What's understood ain't gotta be explained
So for those who understand, meet Dwayne
For eight and a half months I gave Miss Cita pain
Now it's Young Money baby, keep the change
My momma say "Fuck em!", and we the same
So hello motherfucker, you got some sheets to change
And ain't it funny how people change like Easter Sunday
You know, church fit, then outfit
Bright pink and green chest look house-lit
Bright pinky rings, but that ain't about this
What you 'bout, bitch?
Excuse my French emotion and my passion
But I wear my heart on my sleeve like it's the new fashion
What are you askin'? If I don't have the answer
It's probably on the web, like I'm a damn tarantula
But I know you don't understand
Cause you thought Lil Wayne was Weezy but Weezy is Wayne

[Hook: Nina Simone]
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Spoken: Lil Wayne]
I was watchin' TV the other day, right?
Got this white guy on there talking 'bout black guys
Talking about how young black guys are targeted
Targeted by who? America
You see, one in every one hundred Americans are locked up
One in every nine Black Americans are locked up
And see, what the white guy was trying to stress was that
The money that we spend on sending a motherfucker to jail
A young motherfucker to jail
Would be less to send his or her young ass to college

See, and another thing the white guy was stressing was that our jails are populated with drug dealers. You know, crack cocaine? Yeah, stuff like that. Meaning, due to the laws we have on crack cocaine and regular cocaine, the police are... only..., I don't want to say only right, but shit... Only logic, by riding around in the hood all day, and not in the suburbs, because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood. And um, you know, the other thing is mostly found – You know where I'm going... But why bring a motherfucka to jail if it's not gonna stand up in court? Because this drug ain't that drug. You know; level three, level four drug, shit like that

Mhm... I guess it's all a misunderstanding. And um, I sit back and think, well shit, us young motherfuckers, you know, that one in every nine: We probably only selling the crack cocaine just because we in the hood and it's not like your suburbs. We don't have the things that you have. Why? I really don't want to know the answer. But, I guess we just misunderstood huh? Yeah

You know, we don't have room in the jail now for the real motherfuckers, the real criminals, you know: sex offenders, rapists, serial killers, shit like that. Oh, don't get scared, don't get scared, I know you saw one of them sex offender papers! Don't trip, he live right on the end of your block, mhm. Yeah, that nigga live right down the street from you. Sex offender, on the level 3 drug. Convicted, ex-con, yeah, check him out

And what you got, you got daughters, son, what you got? Yeah, well you know what? (coughing) Don't stop the track, that's the good weed

You know what, I have a fucking daughter You understand me? And, why the fuck would you bring my neighbor to jail just because the reason why he live next door to me ain't the reason why I live next door to him. Meanin', he didn't rap his way to my fuckin' neighborhood. He sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood. You move him out, bring him to jail for life, and then you move in a sex offender, hahaha. Then give me a paper, haha Is that a misunderstanding? 'Cause I don't understand it

Another thing; let me take my glasses off, 'cause I want to see the reaction on the faces when I say this. Uhh, Mr. Al Sharpton: here's why I don't respect you and nobody like you

Mhm, see, you're the type that gets off, on gettin' on other people, haha. That's not good, no homo, and rather un-human, I should say. I mean, given the fact that humanity, well, good humanity, rather, to me, is helping one another, no matter your color or race. But this guy, and people like him, they'd rather speculate before they informate, if that's a word, haha. You know, "'spec before check," anyway. Meanin', I'd much rather you talk to me first and see if you can learn an opinion before you make one. Just my thought of good humanity, Mr. Sharpton, haha

Hold on, I ain't finished wit' you man. Gotta pluck the ashes, mhmm, hold on, um

Mr. Sharpton, and anyone like you, you don't know me. So, if you're not gonna try to, then what you say or think about me, or whatever I do, is totally Casper the Friendly Ghost to me. And, it doesn't make you a good person to criticize before you improvise. Doesn't necessarily make you a bad person neither, but the characteristics fall heavily into bad's way, haha!

But, since I am human, I am good and bad as well. But I try my hardest to stay good. And some of the things I do and say may be bad, or just, not too good. But I do try. So with that said, I don't fault you. I mean, you're only human. Good or bad. but I also don't respect you, and I don't care if that's good or bad, haha

You see, you are no MLK, you are no Jesse Jackson. You are nobody, to me. You're just another Don King with a perm. Just a little more political. And that just means you're a little un-human than us humans. And now, let me be human, by saying fuck Al Sharpton, and anyone like him

Fuck if you understand me. I love being misunderstood. Haha, why? 'Cause I live in the suburbs, but I come from the hood. Bring the hook in!

[Hook: Nina Simone]
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Lollipop (Remix) (Ft. Kanye West & Static Major)

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
No homo
I say, he's so sweet, make her wanna lick the wrapper
Remix, baby!

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Lollipop, lollipop, breastses just like Dolly Parton
She ride my spaceship 'til she hit the top
That hit the spot, 'til she ask
"How many li-i-li-i-licks do it take 'til she get to shop?"
Don't worry why my wrists got so freeze
Tell her, "Girl, like Doritos, that's not yo cheese"
Tell her friends, "Like Fritos, I'm tryin' to lay"
I can't only have one and I ain't tryin' to wait
This a song with Wayne, so you know it's gonna melt
But you ain't finna murder me like everybody else
I'ma rap like I got some type of respect for myself
I don't do it for my health, man, I do it for the belt
Man, I do it to the death, 'til the roof get melt
Hundred degrees, drop the roof, so the coupe don't melt
Man, the flow so cold chicken soup won't help
We need fo' mo' hoes, we need oh-oh-oh-oh!
You know what it is when we're outta town
We ball in two-seats, and you out of bounds
So come here, baby girl
You're now fuckin' with the best in the world
Lollipop, the best in the world

[Hook: Static Major]
She lick me like a lollipop
Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Shawty say she wanna lick the wrapper
And she gonna lick the rapper
And I just wanna act like a porno-flickin' actor
I Anita Bake her, now she caught up in the Rapture
I got so much chips I swear they call me Hewlett Packard
I got so much chips you can have a bag if you're a snacker
Greedy motha-fudge cake, now tell me how that fudge tastes
I do it for Bloods' sake, soo-woo, think it's voodoo
How that roof do di-di-dissipate, your girl wants to participate
She so so sophisticate, 'cause her brain is off the chain
And then my diamonds are in the choir
Because they sing from off my chain
And my Nina just joined the gang, because all she do is bang
Like Ricky Martin, Wayne and Kanye: pick your poison
If that woman wanna cut, then tell her I am Mr. Ointment
Tell her to make an appointment
With Mr. I-Can't-Make-An-Appointment
Take my lollipop and enjoy it

[Hook: Static Major]
Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Why would she? She probably be the odd cookie
In the plastic bag 'bout to get crushed by a building
I flushed out the feelin' of me bein' the shit
'Cause I was leavin' skid marks on everywhere I sit
I am everywhere, I'm it, like Hide-n-Go
And I can go anywhere: innie, minnie, miney, mo
I'm in your neighborhood, area, CD thing, tape deck
IPod, your girlfriend, and she say I got great sex
Safe sex is great sex, better wear a latex
'Cause you don't want that late text, that "I think I'm late" text
So wrap it up!
But he's so sweet she wanna lick the wrapper

[Hook: Static Major]
Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps

I don't care what he say, no I don't care what he say
Because, they can say what they want girl
But they will never change my views

I'm Me

[Intro]
The hottest under the sun (who dat?)
Ain't nobody fuckin' with me, man
And you already know that, pimpin'
Cash Money Records, where dreams come true
Fuck up my dream, somebody gon' die tonight
And you already know that, pimpin'
Aye, it's Cash Money Records, man, a lawless gang

[Verse 1]
Un-fucking-believable! Lil Wayne's the president
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, even if they celibate
I know the game is crazy, it's more crazy than it's ever been
I'm married to that crazy bitch; call me Kevin Federline
It's obvious that he'll be Cash Money 'til the death of him
The ground shall break when they bury him—bury him?
I know one day they got to bury him
Better lock my casket tight, baby, so I don't let the Devil in
People, it's just me and my guitar
Yeah, bitch, I'm heavy metallin'
You can get the fuckin' Led Zeppelin
Niggas is bitches, bitches, I think they full of estrogen
And we hold court and take your life for a settlement
Yes, I am the best—and no, I ain't positive, I'm definite
I know the game like I'm reffin' it
This is Tha Carter, Tha Carter 3, the New Testament
And I'm the God, and this is what I bless 'em with

[Hook]
Bitch, I'm me, I'm me, I'm me, I'm me
Baby, I'm me, so who you?
You're not me, you're not me
And I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a motherfuckin' Cash Money Millionaire
I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a motherfuckin' Cash Money Millionaire
Yeah, Junior

[Verse 2]
It's Cash Money over everythang
It's in my blood, I feel it runnin' in every vein
I'm from the mud, I am a missile like a Scud
What's really good, I'm 'bout that ruckus like Fudd
And I stayed on my flo' at Cash Money, like a rug
Tied to the fuckin' Birdman like a lug
And dear Mr. Ronald Williams
To you I shall forever give thanks like a pilgrim
Cash Money million-heir to the throne
Goin' at their heads, like hair in a comb
Sittin' by the window, I just stare at the storm
Know I'll make it through it like hair in a comb
Young Money over bitches, my niggas trust my senses
And I will take a dasher as the Lord is my witness
And you all have witnessed, but I am not finished
So keep your mouth closed and let your eyes listen

[Hook]
Bitch, I'm me, I'm me, I'm me, I'm me
Baby, I'm me, so who you?
You're not me, you're not me
And I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a motherfuckin' Cash Money Millionaire
I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a motherfuckin' Cash Money Millionaire

[Verse 3]
Last year they had the Grammy's and left me in Miami
Sleepin' on a nigga like I'm rappin' in my jammies
I'm rappin' when you sleep
I was rappin' when you were in jammies
Mel Gibson flow, Lethal Weapon, book 'em, Danny
I'm a monster, I tell you, Monster Wayne
I have just swallowed the key to the House of Pain
Now I'm stuck here to deal with the house's pain
Fuck with me, I will peel like the house's paint—let's go!
Niggas don't wanna see me ‘cause I'm better in bold
The only time I will depend is when I'm 70 years old
That's when I can't hold my shit within, so I shit on myself
‘Cause I'm so sick and tired of shittin' on everybody else
I try to tell you like I'm sayin' somethin'
I'm from the Dirty like the bottom of my pants cuff
And now nothin' gonna stop me, so just envy it
Hey, I'll accept a friendly quit, ha ha

[Hook]
Bitch, I'm me, I'm me, I'm me, I'm me
Baby, I'm me, so who you?
You're not me, you're not me
And I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a motherfuckin' Cash Money Millionaire
I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a motherfuckin' Cash Money Millionaire, bitch!

[Outro]
The hottest under the sun (who dat?)
Ain't nobody fuckin' with me, man
And you already know that, pimpin'
Cash Money Records, where dreams come true
(Who dat?) Somebody gon die tonight
And you already know that, pimpin'
Aye, it's Cash Money Records, man, a lawless gang

Gossip

[Intro]
I hate gossip
And I don't walk around looking for it, you know?
But, yesterday it seemed to just
Wander around 'til it found me
You know like, the gossip found me
Then why don't try provin' it?
How? You don't know how to prove it?
Well, what you just do is, stop
(Streetrunner)

[Verse 1]
Stop! Hatin' on a nigga
That is a weak emotion, the lady of a nigga
And you can get tipped like you're waitin' on a nigga
Put a body bag and an apron on a nigga
I give my all behind the mic
But you can never see if you sit behind the light
And you don't have to pick me to win the title fight
But I'mma wear that championship belt so tight
And if I'm wrong, there is no right
And if I'm wrong, there is Snow White
I'm tryna be polite
But you bitches in my hair like the fuckin' po-lice
And my flow is rare, these other rappers nice
These other rappers bark, some of 'em even bite
But I'm much more bright, I give the game sight
So before you dim the light, you just might, might wanna

[Refrain]
Think it over
Ooooh, think it over
Think it over, baby baby (Get 'em)

[Verse 2]
Stop! Analyzing, criticizing
You should realize what I am and start epitomizing
Legitimate, I got the heart of the biggest lion
I'm confident, like fuck 'em all, pull out my dick and ride it
My flow sick, so sick, it's like my shit is dying
It rains a lot in my city because my city's crying
Because my city's dying
Still I emerge from all of that, I am a living pion–eer, near Zion
Fear God, not them, steer my robin coupe
Through the streets of the Boot, and soo-woo!
And then I leak blood in the booth, I leave a bloodbath
Sorry, there's a tub in the booth, now where the drugs at?
I'm twisted like the strings on a shoe, no, nigga, fuck that
I'm twisted like the strings on a boot, now where New Orleans at?
I feel hip-hop stole me like a bus pass
So in your possession, I-I-I must ask

[Refrain]
Hey, haven't I been good to you?
(Think it over) Tell me, haven't I been sweet to you?

[Verse 3]
Drag my name through the mud, I come out clean
Cast away stones, I won't even blink
A gun is not a math problem, I won't even think
Just leave you dead like the mink under my sink
Don't believe in me, don't believe me
I graduated from hungry and made it to greedy
My flow is like pasta, take it and eat it
But I'm gon' need cheese if I'm baking a ziti
You niggas want beef, I want a steak, and, uh, we be
Lost in Amsterdam or Jamaica where weed be
Hardbody nigga just takin' it easy
All about my paper, 'bout my paper like E-Z
Wider wrappers, why do rappers lie to fans, lie to rappers?
Lot of rappers lie like actors, cut the motherfuckin' cameras
Cut the check, nigga, fuck your props
And make it out to "Mr. Hip-Hop"

[Outro]
I'm not dead, I'm alive

Press a button, watch the motherfucker do tricks
I don't know what you're on, but I'm on some new shit
While your bitch is on my dick like a glue stick
I got a grill, I don't have to get my tooth fixed
The tooth fairy would retire if I lose it
Straight out the clip, that's how I spit, like an Uzi
You can't find me 'cause I'm lost in the music
I'm running this, and I can jump the hurdles
I'm feeling like I'm racing a bunch of little turtles
Keep a bandana like the Ninja Turtles
I'm like a turtle when I sip the purple

[Hook]
And I smoke that kush

I'm so aware
I'm so prepared
I'm so fly I will take off into the open air

Love Me or Hate Me

And if so
Make sure my kids see my cash
And I know
I'm solid like an elbow cast
And my future will be better than my past
Weezy!

[Hook]
You can love me or hate me
I swear it won't make me or break me
I'm going wherever the money take me
Until they funeral and wake me
And don't wake me
'Cause I'm sleeping
I'm dreaming
I know that there's a better way
'Cause I've seen it, Lord
But this faster money is so convenient
And I need it
Say I need it

[Verse 2]
C-A-R, T-E-R
I spit movies like a VCR
I spit rounds like the Tiki bar
And if I got beef I'm the meat cleav-er
And I are
The illest nigga Martin Luther King died for
And I ride for
Hollygrove, One-Seven, Eagle Street
And I'm higher than an eagle's feet
But I believe in me
Apple is the cross street
I am just an offspring
Born in the ghetto
That's why I can't let go
One call I'll have my dogs on ya like an echo
Baby, I am the real deal, no pickle
Uh, spit sickle-cell psycho
I go
Off, like a motherfucking rifle
And I'm from
The underground baby, like a pipe hole
And I will stand tall like light poles
Until the light blows

[Hook]
And you can love me or hate me
Baby, I swear it won't make me or break me
And I be going wherever the money take me
Until they funeral and wake me
And don't wake me
'Cause I'm sleeping
And I'm dreaming
See I'm just hustling
Living what I believe in, dog
And it's a problem when our homies not eating
And I'm greedy
I'm greedy

[Verse 3]
Share my blood
Feed my family
My flow will have to plead insanity
So sick I need Gray's Anatomy
Acid, like a bust open battery
I'm cool like L.A. nights
I'm tight like ballet tights
Ay, Juelz
I swear the other day I pissed Cristal
These bitches tryna kick it like Juntao
I gotta watch my head in the battle
I'm just trying to stay ahead of my shadow
And I'm floating like a boat and a paddle
Alligators and rattlesnakes
But I promise I will take a nigga off, like a Saturday
Got money to validate
I'm icy like carrot cake
Different colored diamonds make me look like a salad plate
I'm straight out the alleyway
It's the nigga ya daddy hate
Weezy F. Baby – Great

[Hook]
I know they love me then hate me
But I'm a G –
It won't make me or break me
And you can find me wherever the money place me
Yeah, until you're riding to the late me
And don't wake me
'Cause I'm sleeping
And I'm dreaming
And me and my Lord got an agreement, y'all
And so I thank him every day for my achievements
And I'm Weezy
I'm Weezy

Playing With Fire (Ft. Betty Wright)

[Intro]
(StreetRunner)

[Hook: Betty Wright]
So you've got so many diamonds
You wear all the finest clothes
And your grill is shining
As you're driving down the streets of gold
But you can't blame me
If I set this stage on fire!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Momma always told me I was crazy
And my hoes say I'm amazing but I don't listen to a lady
But the bitch say I'm hot, and I say "No bitch, I'm blazing"
Like, what the fuck you expect? I'm a motherfucking Cajun
I feel caged in my mind, it's like my flow doing time
I goes crazy inside, but when it comes out it's fine
Like wine; wait, watch...
See? I get better with time like a watch
Osh B'Gosh, Posh Spice husband
Couldn't kick it like I kick it, bitch, I Kix it
No cereal, like a landing, I sticks it
Wherever she asks me, after she licks it
That's too explicit, well why you listening?
I smell smoke, and something's sizzling
That's her pussy, so hey pussy, play with pussy or play pussy

[Hook: Betty Wright]
But you can't blame me
If I set this stage on fire

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
They say you're nobody 'til somebody kills you
Well, where I'm from you're nobody 'til you kill somebody
And you know what they say, when you great
It's not murder, it's assassinate
So assassinate me, bitch
Cause I'm doing the same shit Martin Luther King did
Checking in the same hotel, in the same suite, bitch
Same balcony like "Assassinate me, bitch!"
It's Lil Tunechi
I don't rap, I film movies
With my rap, you could call me
"Mr. Director's Chair," yeah, and that's a wrap
Cut! On to the next
Not the next scene, bitch, the next check
Some say the X makes the sex 'spect
So play with the pussy or play pussy

[Hook: Betty Wright & Lil Wayne]
So you've got so many diamonds (Hey pussy)
You wear all the finest clothes
(Lay pussy, do what I, say pussy
And I say, I say, lay pussy)
And your grill is shining
(Lay pussy, lay pussy, haha, hey pussy)
As you're driving down the streets of gold
But you can't blame me
If I set this stage on fire!
(Hey pussy, don't play pussy
Get 'em!)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Straight off the corner of Apple and Eagle
Braveheart, bitch, like the times are medieval
Married to the game, divorced the cathedral
Standing on the corner selling porcelain to people
Forced into evil, it's all in your head
It's all so cerebral, call me Knievel
You follow and I lead you, straight to the needles
The bottles, the battles, the beetles'll eat you
Momma named Cita, I love you Cita
'Member when your pussy second husband tried to beat ya?
'Member when I went into the kitchen, got the cleaver?
He ain't give a fuck, I ain't give a fuck neither
He could see the devil, see the devil in my features
He could smell the ether, you can see Cita
You can see the Cita, see the Cita in my features
And she don't play neither

[Hook: Betty Wright]
But you can't blame me
If I set this stage on fire!

Piru Dreams

As Da World Turns by Gudda Gudda (Ft. Lil Wayne, Mack Maine & Shanell)

[Bridge - Lil Wayne]
As I watch the trees fall down to the pavement
And a breeze turn to blazes

[Verse 1 - Gudda Gudda]
I’mma tell these niggas: “motherfuck the world”
On the real, nigga feel this
Punch a hole in the system like I got a steel fist
I don’t trust a soul nigga, so I ride alone
And I’ve been paranoid ever since I got a phone
Yeah, better roll or get rolled over
You too cool nigga? You could get the cold shoulder
I’m from the city where the skinny niggas die
Ride, I survived and I made it out alive
And they wonder why my face look blank
Cause I don’t give a fuck about what they say or think
Uh, nigga you see me with that face wall paint
Come on, pick your poison in the spray of a shake
Militant minded, the way Gudda think
You could meet the devil, better pray for the saints
Militant minded, the way Gudda think
Nigga you could meet the devil…

[Hook - Lil Wayne]
One day this world gon’ turn to ashes
So where’s my matches? Where’s my matches?
I blow the flame out, the world is dark now
And everybody need their spark now
And I’m like: “Where’s my matches? Where’s my matches?”
Put the whole world in a casket
And I’m gon’ watch this world just burn to ashes
Turn to ashes, turn to ashes

[Bridge - Lil Wayne]
As I watch the trees fall down to the pavement
And a breeze turn to blazes

[Verse 2 - Gudda Gudda]
Starin’ at the world through my rear view
Gotta stay high just so I can keep a clear view
Tryna do right, but I’m swervin’ in the left lane
Tryna stay out of that black hole, watch my step man
They say money is the root of all evil
And we love it, so I guess me and you are all equal
Shit ain’t been the same since Hurricane Katrina
Ike and Rita, what happened with the FEMA?
Government officials not keeping it official
Like a ref with no whistle, so I’m tackling the issues
And they wonder why we act the way we act
Murder, murder, steal, steal, and sell crack to get stacks, but…

[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne]
Where’s my matches? Where’s my matches?
Put the whole world in a casket
And I’m gon’ watch this world just burn to ashes
Turn to ashes
One day this world gon’ turn to ashes
And I’mma just sit back laughing
And when I tried to kick that habit
Man I was like: “Where’s my matches? Where’s my matches?”
This whole world is aware of my actions
But they ain’t that bad compared to taxes
Ashes, all I see is ashes
As the world burns

[Verse 4 - Mack Maine]
I’m a young arsonist on my late night Johnny Carson shit
I ain’t never gave a fuck about the world
Cause they don’t give a fuck about me, or my girl
Or my mama, in the midst of the drama, ya digg?
They try to pull you all the way back to get ahead of you
Then Internal Revenue gon’ come for your revenue
Sayin’ that you owe 33% of what you make
When the world die, I’mma be rejoicing at the wake

[Bridge - Shanell]
As I watch the trees fall down to the pavement

[Hook - Lil Wayne]
And I’m like: “Where’s my matches? Where’s my matches?”
Put the whole world in a casket
And I’m gon’ watch this world just burn to ashes
Turn to ashes, turn to ashes
One day this world gon’ turn to ashes
So where’s my matches? Where’s my matches?
I blow the flame out, the world is dark now
And everybody need their spark now
And I’m like: “Where’s my matches? Where’s my matches?”
Put the whole world in a casket
And I’m gon’ watch this world just burn to ashes
Turn to ashes, turn to ashes

[Bridge - Lil Wayne]
As I watch the trees fall down to the pavement

[Intro]
You know, This just some real nigga shit, a real nigga story
You know what I'm saying?

[Hook]
Slang a bunch of narcotics
Pull up in the new 'rarri
Living like John Gotti
Chopping bricks like karate
Drink a bunch of codeine
Serving to the dope fiends
Blowing money, stay clean
Michael Jackson, Billie Jean

[Verse 1: Future]
Got a Panamera round a young nigga neck
Got a young bitch pulling up in a vet
Smoke a lot of kush and I have a lot of sex
Had to beat the grind up, ran up my check
Bitch nigga get money, nigga get that
Roll a blunt of chronic, nigga sell a lot of crack
You can hit a nigga line, order what you want
I can whoop a Maserati, pulling up a donk
50,000 on yo watch, young nigga splurge
Pop a ace of spade bottle, sip a lot of syrup
Keep a young nigga workin' gotta buss a cape
I'mma take a phone call, hustle everyday

[Hook]
Slang a bunch of narcotics
Pull up in the new 'rarri
Living like John Gotti
Chopping bricks like karate
Drink a bunch of codeine
Serving to the dope fiends
Blowing money, stay clean
Michael Jackson, Billy Jean

[Verse 2: Future]
Whipping up a cake, just to go and snatch a spider
Young nigga play with keys, like a type writer
Al Capone, John Gotti was a nigga idol
I was never snitching, I can put it on the Bible
In a 4 door beamer, driving with a rifle
Nigga where you at, nigga we go pull up on ya
Young Bitch looking like Janet in the 80's
We was grinding up from a tube and a baby
Got the girl dripping wet like a Jheri curl
Got a styrofoam cup and its full of syrup
Send it over from Lil Mexico and let me work
I can get 36 for a clean shirt

Pop a lot of pain pills
Bout to put rims on my skateboard wheels
Beat that pussy up like Emmett Till
Yeah....
Two cell phones ringin' at the same time
That's your ho, callin' from two different phones
Tell that bitch "leave me the fuck alone!"
See, you fuck her wrong, and I fuck her long
I got a love-hate relationship with Molly
I'd rather pop an ollie, and my dick is a trolley
Boy, I'll bury you like Halle
And these hoes say I'm blind
Cause I don't see nothin' wrong with a little bump and grind
Man I just received a package
Them other niggas taxin'
And my pockets so fat, I'm startin' to feel contractions
And my cousin went to jail for them chickens
And he already home and that nigga must be snitchin'
Cut him off like karate!

Stay Hood by Waka Flocka Flame (Ft. Lil Wayne)

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
I'ma stay hood 'til the day that I die
Yeah
‘Til the day that I die
I’ma twist this weed, my nigga, let’s get high

I come from the hood where you don’t testify
Take murder with no tears off in your fucking eyes

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka]
All my niggas ride, where I come from, ain’t no fair ones, nigga
Fuck you thinking?
Have a fuck boy Pacquiao planking
‘Til the loud got plain, too, drinking
50K for a show, no popping
Spit izzle to a dumb bitch ears
Broke niggas can’t talk like this
Rolex on my main bitch wrist
Blood bottoms on a young nigga boots
Looks like I just stomped a nigga out
Get your man down, nigga, lights out
Shoot at your ass, what that mouthing about?
He ain’t tough no more, what’s happening?
Outside your mama house, what’s cracking?
Popping mollies like Tylenols and Aspirin
Geeked up, pulled up, hyena laughin’
Them boys ain’t real, stop acting like us
In the squad, I bust, get cheese like crust
I’m the only motherfucker that I really trust
In a bad bitch’s guts – always
Counting money like always
Getting money from three ways
I could never, ever see no rainy days

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]

[Verse 2: Lil’ Wayne]
Hollygrove in this motherfucker
I’m tired of all these bitch niggas
These motherfuckers like Robitussin
I’m rolling up with my bitch, nigga
As a matter of fact, she roll it for me
Swisher Sweets, swish, nigga
Hit that shit like an open jumper
Rest in peace Li'l Beezy
I wish my nigga could see me now
Motherfuckers better king me
I’ma walk around wearing Jesus’ crown
These niggas just pussy
I’ma let that chopper eat ‘em out
Dead body in the bushes
Well, that’s the bush you don’t beat around
Beat your ass with my skateboard
Weed loud like it make noise
I’m on them trees like acorns
My cellphone going napalm
Guns sound like bass drums
Young Money, drum section
Psycho, ward, nigga. 1-7, Tunechi

So I let the bitch hang out with me right
You know word got around I was fucking this nigga bitch
So the nigga called me, he like "You fuckin my bitch?"-
I'm like "I'm fuckin her right now"

Told that bitch take your shoes off, look don't even argue
Got your bitch tip-toeing on Italian Marble

Cars, cribs that's eight hoes
Nine piece that's dinner rolls
Wild freaks, that centerfold
Hundred on my shine
You don't like it fine
Got ya bitch tip-toeing like Gregory Hines
Cashing out with that nina
Ten days you ain't seen her
She ask for it, I beat it
You greedy nigga you eat it
These corny niggas all on my dick
Princess cuts all in my wrist
Hundred rounds all in my hip
200 grand all in my whip

Got ya bitch tip-toein' on my marble floors
Red bottoms only for the centerfolds
Big bodies I got 10 of those
Whippin' work, it smelling like they dinner rolls

We call a undercover, a pig in the blanket
Uh, lifestyles of the rich and famous
Shoot you in ya head like Abraham Lincoln
Stuntin' on them bitches like Birdman
Roll the weed in white sheets, Ku Klux Klan
Put it on the scale, watch it do numbers
Playing with them keys like Stevie Wonder
All my hoes pretty, all my niggas brazy

Call me Tunechi Lee or don't call me at all
Man fuck all you niggas, pause!

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Got ya bitch tip-toein' on my marble floors
Red bottoms only for the centerfolds
Big bodies I got 10 of those
Whippin' work, it smelling like they dinner rolls

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz, that's your best answer
Cup filled with pink, I'm supporting breast cancer
I might do that walk for the 5k
I get paid every time I leave my driveway
Got yo girl tip-toeing on my marble floors
Sitting by the pool, jumping off the diving board
Getting to the money I'mma need a money counter
So many acres, my neighbors stay in another county
Ted DiBiase in Versace loafers
All you talk is shit nigga, halitosis
Ghosts, I pulled up in that pale thang
Got a Chanel chain, on top of Chanel chain, on top of Chanel chain, on top of Chanel chain
GODDAMN!

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Got ya bitch tip-toein' on my marble floors
Red bottoms only for the centerfolds
Big bodies I got 10 of those

She Don't Put It Down by Joe Budden (Ft. Lil Wayne & Tank)

[Intro: Joe Budden]
She ain’t got a leg to stand on
Don’t even trip

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
I can take you all over the world though
Even tell you pack light
The last slide couldn’t even get a cab ride
She don’t do the blogs, but if she did, she’d be on mad sites
Ass so mean that I’m always on her bad side
Uh, now she don’t ever stress me ’bout my whereabouts
Never seems concerned
With other birds that she may hear about
She mind hers, since mine's hers
That shit she barely care about
Look amazing on me, why I’m always tryna wear her out
She don’t ride like you, no, she don’t taste like that
Not with a waist like that, do I let her go to waste like that?
She a mix between Kama Sutra, yoga and porno flicks
Funny how her breath get shorter when I give her long dick
Uh, and I’m telling y’all straight up
Might think I imagined shorty even when she not made-up
She kill ‘em in Levi’s, see why? It ain’t even fair
Look good in whatever she wear
How could other women compare? They can’t

[Hook: Tank]
I done put another in your space
Damn, after you, it’s been hard to replace
I just want the same judge sitting on the case
She gon' hate, but she know
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you
Girl, you working with the killer
Ain’t nobody fucking with ya
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I can see the stars in the day time
Bitch, I miss you, like a deadline
And the girl I’m with is just the girl I’m with
I mean it’s working out, so we’re staying fit
But you know love is nothing; ask Stan Smith
But I gotta keep a bad bitch, like Brad Pitt
Remember our first kiss? Or our last kiss?
I used to go dummy in that pussy; crash test
You be fuckin' that nigga like you was fucking me?
Ha, fuck that nigga! He can’t fuck with me
I’m Tunechi, bitch, and you know that
And that pussy throw back
But any given night, I’d still pop that ass, like a Prozac
Girl, you know you got that murder, a beast in that La Perla
And every time we cut, I used to shred her; Ninja Turtles
And I know you still love me, and I know you still for me
That’s why we still fuckin'
‘Cause she don’t put it down like you

[Hook: Tank]
I done put another in your space
Damn, after you, it’s been hard to replace
I just want the same judge sitting on the case
She gon' hate, but she know
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you
Girl, you working with the killer
Ain’t nobody fucking with ya
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
Love being around mine, no downtime
Still nothing else even matters
Can’t even walk slow through that mall
‘Cause paparazzi running after
Baby girl working it like a pro, slow it down or move it faster
Whether them lights on or them lights off
Like I’m sleeping with the clapper
Say she watching what she eat, yet that ass keep getting fatter
How I’m sexing her
Makes that ex of hers no longer be a factor
Plus her and I already know, you done turn them all to Casper
Climb with the former rather latter
You already know which one I’d rather cum on

[Hook: Tank]
I done put another in your space
Damn, after you, it’s been hard to replace
I just want the same judge sitting on the case
She gon' hate, but she know
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you
Girl, you working with the killer
Ain’t nobody fucking with ya
She don’t put it down like you, down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you

Now turn around, face down; I'm arrestin' this bitch
All my bitches love me, and I love all my bitches

Weed and syrup, yeah
Who we is? Young Mooolah, baby!
Got that right shorty
Bigg D on the track!

[Hook]
I'm just, staring at the world
From a Cadillac window, baby
Hoping this girl in my passenger don't act funny with me
Get her to my home, we get naked like some new born babies
I'm ready to perform and she's gon' be my audience
And she said "Bravo"
And I said "I know"
And she said "Encore"
Girl, I'm really big on you
So what you wanna do?
Too fly you need a parachute
But that just means you're falling in love

[Verse 1]
In love with a skater
Five six seven, man, I already ate her
She had a coffee mug and a pair of Uggs
Got some makeup on my shirt when she gave me a hug
Shorty got me open
Pussy so good wish I could smoke it
Where your mans at?
Remember me like this one time at band camp, yeah!
Like that man, she on my mind all day, check my CAT scan
Hey, where you going with all that?
I fuck her till she whine and then I drink a tall glass

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Girl you gon' make me take you
To your desired destination
Left leg, right leg, segregation
Cause I know you like that shit, cause I love that shit
Girl that's my hole, I dug that ditch
And when it gets cold, I'm there for her to hold
She climbs my pole, beat that pussy like she stole something
And she so fine
From the front from the side from behind
Pop that pussy like a cork and I'mma fuck you till you whine

Okay I stick to the G code, you stick to the zip code
Money tall like Benjamin Franklin on tip-toes
Your bitch a blowfish, she swallow my fishing pole
I aim at your head, it’s coming off like stripper clothes
I fuck with guerrillas, bust at the Feds
I bet your mouth can’t run if I cut off your legs
I’m fly like a zipper, but that ain’t the point
My bullets fat as a joint, your head crack like a voice
I come to wet up the party, you niggas is garbage

We catch everything out the air, bare hand no mitten
If my name get mentioned, a nigga gon’ slay you
Catch ya down broad day with your bitch, a nigga still gon’ spray you
What it cost to murk a snitch? Ho, that’s cheap labor
If you survive these 50 shots, you was in God’s favor
Big guns, I’mmma send your mom my condolences
But if she with you when I hit you, you know how us niggas from New Orleans is
Everybody get it, everybody gon’ feel it
Nobody exempt, every charge I got was a murder
In the boot, nigga ain’t no attempts

She told me that if I give her a tip she give me bank head like Bowen Homes
She tried to lock that pussy up, but I came through like bail bonds
White seat (yeah), white mink (yeah), white car, I'm the black Fonz (Fonz)
Www.I-fucked-the-shit-out-of-her.com
Say yeah nigga I'm back (I'm back), yeah nigga I'm back (I'm back)
Tell Mitt Romney fall back, my president still black
I ain't gotta press no buttons nigga, I wake up with my swag on
Y'all niggas is broke (broke) your pockets should have a cast on (hah)
Bitches think I'm a photographer, my next tape with that flash on
My waist stay with that flash on, it's lights out when I clap on
I'm lit nigga, I'm lit nigga, like Times Square when the ball drop (drop)
Word is they be sleeping on me, well make this they alarm clock
Bitch I..

[Hook 2X: Lil Wayne]
Black out in that pussy, I black out in that pussy
I'm addicted, like she got a crackhouse in that pussy
Man I smash out in that pussy, then I pass out in that pussy
We stomp that nigga out, and watch him drag out that pussy

[Lil Wayne]
She don't even know me like that, uh
But she gon' learn today, yeah
And every big dog like cat, girl
And they done let me out my cage and she told me
She need me in her life, but I told her
You need dick in your life, and she said
You know, you're probably right
Great minds think alike, and then I paint her white
So I can

[Hook]

[Juelz Santana]
Living la vida loca, I hate being sober
These niggas sayin' I broke but, I bet them nigga broker (ha)
I'm Batman and you Joker's, she gave me neck, choke her
And I have the super, so yeah nigga I soaked her (yup)
Damn, that's your lady? Damn, that's your lady?
She got your name tatted, that's crazy, I cover that with my babies (yup)
Told her to come downstairs, we did it all in my Caddy'
Asked her where them kids is at, she said upstairs with they daddy (WHOOO)
Money coming in by the packs, everyday I pop tags
In the club wasting this cash; bitch, keep bouncing that ass
She said real niggas don't last, they say real niggas don't last
Nah, it's just too many fake niggas making real niggas look bad
Get lost with your lame ass, livin' fast - no brake pads
Stop (stop), wait (wait), now frame that
My lifestyle ain't for bitch niggas, I use lifestyles on your bitch, nigga
I see a bitch, I want a bitch, and I just tell my bitch get it
And I
